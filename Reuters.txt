Republicans hold a 11-9 majority on the committee, which held a four-day confirmation hearing last month, and control the Senate by a 52-48 margin.The committee's chairman, Republican Chuck Grassley, defended Gorsuch as a mainstream jurist worthy of confirmation despite the complaints of many Democrats, and that \"there isn't a whole lot of mystery\" that the panel will approve the nomination.\"Over the last couple months, the nominee's opponents have tried to find fault with him. That fault will not stick,\" Grassley said.Democrats are planning to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster that requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to cut off debate and allow a confirmation vote. The actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped.So far, 37 Democrats have backed such a move. To date, three Democrats have said they support Gorsuch, and the Republicans would have to secure eight Democratic votes to kill a filibuster.If confirmed to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch, 49, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, would restore the nine-seat high court's conservative majority, fulfilling one of Trump's top campaign promises.Republican Senate leaders insist Gorsuch will be confirmed on Friday regardless of what the Democrats do.\"What I can tell you is Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed this week. How that happens really depends on our Democratic friends,\" Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that it was \"highly, highly unlikely\" that Republicans would get 60 votes.If Republicans cannot win over eight Democrats, McConnell could force a vote by changing long-standing Senate rules to allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, a move sometimes called the \"nuclear option\" that Trump has urged.While Gorsuch's opponents would fight such a rule change, it was the Democrats who in 2013 changed the Senate rules to limit filibusters after Republican use of the procedure against nominees selected by Democratic former President Barack Obama. The Senate, then led by Democrats, barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices.Many Democrats have accused Republicans of \"stealing\" a Supreme Court seat because the Republican-led Senate refused last year to consider Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee who opposes Gorsuch, spoke out against any potential deal in the Senate in which Democrats would agree not to filibuster Gorsuch if Republicans agreed to maintain the 60-vote super-majority for the next Supreme Court nominee.\"I will not accept a deal that preserves the 60-vote threshold at the cost of having on the court someone who refuses to say whether he agrees with core constitutional precepts protecting privacy, equality under the law, and protections for workers and consumers, and clean air and water,\" Blumenthal told MSNBC.Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, also a member of the committee, said he would support using the \"nuclear option\" to overcome Democratic objections to Gorsuch but hoped such a move would not be necessary.\"This is a guy who's a mainstream conservative,\" Hatch told CNN, adding that Democrats were seeking payback over Republicans' blocking of Garland.\"We can't let them just stop one of the best nominees ever nominated to the Supreme Court because their far left constituencies are screaming and shouting,\" Hatch said.Republicans have defended Gorsuch as well qualified for the lifetime job as a Supreme Court justice and praised his performance during the confirmation hearings. Democrats have accused Gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of Trump, evading questions on key Supreme Court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending, and favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans.Gorsuch, if confirmed, would immediately be thrust into the high court's current term, which runs from October to June. If he is confirmed on Friday, he would be able to participate in the court's next round of oral arguments in pending cases, starting on April 17.

Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he invited Kushner and Tom Bossert, White House homeland security adviser, to accompany him so they could hear \"first-hand and unfiltered\" from military advisers about the situation on the ground and interact with U.S. forces. \"I said, 'Hey, next time I go to Iraq, if you're interested, come and it\u2019d be good,\" Dunford said, adding he extended the invitation weeks ago. That kind of ground-level awareness of the war helps inform strategic decisions, Dunford said, adding it was the same reason he regularly leaves Washington to visit Iraq.\"The more appreciation you could have for what's actually happening on the ground, the more informed you are when you start talking about the strategic issues,\" Dunford said.Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, did not speak with reporters during the flight to Iraq.Dunford's spokesman, Navy Captain Greg Hicks, said Kushner was traveling on behalf of Trump to express the president's support and commitment to Iraq's government and U.S. personnel helping combat Islamic State.Trump, who campaigned on defeating Islamic State, has yet to announce any dramatic shift in war strategy. U.S. ROLE AFTER MOSUL FIGHT The trip to Iraq comes as Iraqi security forces engage in fierce, house-to-house fighting to retake Mosul, Islamic State's last major stronghold in Iraq and the city where leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate nearly three years ago.Nearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the United Nations. Although the loss of Mosul would deal a major defeat to Islamic State, U.S. and Iraqi officials are preparing for smaller battles even after the city is recaptured and expect the group to go underground to fight as a traditional insurgency.What happens to the U.S. military role in Iraq after Mosul is recaptured remain unclear. Influential Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has previously called on Iraq's government to order the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces after the battle of Mosul is over.Dunford said Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi understood the need for continued U.S. military support.\"It's not our judgment that the Iraqis will be self sustaining and self sufficient in the wake of Mosul. More importantly, it's not Prime Minister Abadi's assessment,\" Dunford said.Across the border in Syria, a U.S.-backed campaign to isolate Islamic State's de facto capital of Raqqa is advancing ahead of an eventual assault on the city. U.S.-backed Syrian forces repelled a major counter-attack by Islamic State militants holding out at the country's largest dam and in the nearby town of Tabqa, the group and activists said on Sunday. The dam is a strategic target in the military campaign, located about 40 km (25 miles) to the east of Raqqa.     (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Giles Elgood)"},

The industry's pipeline of cancer drugs expanded by 63 percent between 2005 and 2015, according to the QuintilesIMS Institute, and a good number are reaching the market.The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold globally to $75.8 billion by 2022 from $16.9 billion in 2015, according to research firm GlobalData.\u00a0\"For cancer drugs in general ... it is hard for us to drive down cost,\" said Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), the nation's largest manager of drug benefit plans for employers and insurers. \"You don't want to be in the position of being told to use the second best cancer drug for your child.\"Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as President Donald Trump, have been grappling with how to restrain rising prescription drug costs. They have talked about solutions ranging from more price negotiation to faster approval of new drugs, often invoking increased competition between drugmakers.\"Competition is key to lowering drug prices,\" Trump told pharmaceutical executives at an Oval Office meeting in January.But that is not happening with new drugs called checkpoint inhibitors that work by releasing a molecular brake, allowing the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way it fights infections caused by bacteria or viruses.For cancers like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients.Bristol's Yervoy, first approved in 2011, targets a protein known as CTLA-4. Other immunotherapies, including Bristol's Opdivo, Keytruda from Merck, Roche's Tecentriq, and Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Bavencio, involve a different protein called PD-1.Other targets are being explored. Some new data will be presented this week in Washington at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting.Current checkpoint inhibitors each have a list price near $150,000 a year. A combination of Yervoy and Opdivo, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for advanced or inoperable melanoma, has a cost of $256,000 a year for patients who respond to the treatment.Similar immunotherapies are in development at companies like AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L). Merck, which declined to comment on pricing plans, expects an FDA decision by May 10 on its combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy as an initial treatment for the most common form of lung cancer - by far the biggest market for cancer drugs.Pfizer said Bavencio, cleared by the FDA earlier this month to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare type of skin cancer, has a price \"comparable to other checkpoint inhibitors approved for different indications.\"The pharmaceutical industry holds that discussion of prescription drug prices has to take into account the major investment required for innovation and discovery of new lifesaving drugs.\u00a0\"UNRESTRAINED PRICING POWER\"Scientific progress, and pricing power, are driving pharmaceutical companies to emphasize oncology research.\"Most of the strategy on the part of pharmaceutical companies assumes unrestrained pricing power,\" said Dr. Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Center for Health Policy Outcomes in New York. \"We don't see evidence that companies are pursuing cost-effective strategies.\"Health insurers have had success in demanding price concessions in some drug categories - like diabetes, where several companies sell similar products and insurers are able to negotiate price discounts or rebates in exchange for coverage.According to IMS, that tactic capped the overall rise in spending on diabetes medicines at 8 percent in 2015, compared with an increase of 30 percent in billed invoices. All of the invoice price growth for insulin was offset by price cuts, the institute said.But discounting is much less common for newer, innovative cancer drugs, mostly given by injection and approved for defined patient populations.Net price growth for branded oncology drugs averaged 4.8 percent in 2015, versus 6.4 percent for invoices, according to IMS.Express Scripts' Miller and others said makers of new cancer medications enjoy pricing power due to coverage requirements, insurance plan structure and a lack of head-to-head comparison studies.\"Cancer drugs don't compete on price,\" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of several studies of drug pricing. \"Drug companies have market exclusivity and we require payers to cover cancer drugs - Medicare has six protected classes, including cancer.\"Medicare, the federal government's healthcare plan for seniors and the disabled, covers most prescription drugs under its \"Part D\" pharmacy benefits. The plans are required to cover all drugs in six classes: cancer, HIV, antidepressants, antispychotics, seizure disorders like epilepsy, and immune system suppressants for people undergoing organ transplantation.Trump met recently with Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch, both Democrats, to discuss draft legislation allowing the government to negotiate Medicare drug prices - but the bill preserves the six protected classes.In addition, drugs given by injection, including many cancer therapies, are covered under Medicare's main medical benefit.Bristol disappointed investors when it did not pursue accelerated FDA review of the Opdivo/Yervoy combination for newly-diagnosed lung cancer - putting Merck ahead in the lucrative lung cancer market.\"All of the immunotherapies have similar price points,\" said Miller at Express Scripts. \"When you stack therapies, it means more expense for patients and (health) plan sponsors.\"(Editing by Edward Tobin)"},

Nine self-driving cars did not quite zoom around a 2-mile (3.2-km) course in Northern California over the weekend in a race involving students and entrepreneurs from startup companies where the real goal was just to make it around the track.Alphabet Inc's Waymo, Uber and major auto companies are competing to create the technology for an autonomous revolution that could reorder the car industry and transform transportation.The goals were more modest for contenders at the Thunderhill West race course, about a two-hour drive north of San Francisco, in the second challenge of Self Racing Cars. All cars competing had a driver behind the wheel to intervene if necessary, and only four of the nine made it around the curvy course without human help.Location services startup Point One was the unofficial winner when its car got around the track in three minutes and  37.9 seconds.The cars took individual turns on the track over the course of the event on Saturday and Sunday.\"Someday you will be able to see machines do things that people aren't able to do. Today we are just trying to catch up with your teenage child's first drive,\" said Self Racing Cars organizer Joshua Schachter, a tech entrepreneur. He saw the race as a chance to push the envelope of new technology.For the small companies and students, the race course offered a large, safe testing environment. Deciding how to slow down for a turn, for instance, is a big question for a car that drives itself, and startups cannot necessarily afford access to a major testing facility without pedestrians.Some cars used GPS and other location tracking to follow digital maps to get around the course. That was the strategy for Point One, which is making a business of determining location more precisely than GPS.Students from online education organization Udacity used artificial intelligence to teach driving on the fly, using a car owned by software company PolySync. On a ride around the track on Sunday, the car navigated a few turns on its own, but the human driver regularly yanked the wheel to keep it on the asphalt.The Bay Area is the center of corporate efforts to build a commercial self-driving car, and test vehicles navigate San Francisco streets with a human behind the wheel. Some are doing well. Recent state data showed that Waymo cars were traveling about 5,000 miles (8,000 km) between interventions by the person in the driver's seat.

We think we'll find more,\" Villagarzon Mayor Jhon Ever Calderon told Reuters. He said the town had no coffins or sanitary storage.Many families in Mocoa stayed up through the night to search through the debris, despite the lack of electricity in the city.\"I need to know where they are, if they are injured or where to find them,\" sobbed Maria Lilia Tisoy, 37, looking through the rubble for her two daughters, one pregnant, and a 4-year-old granddaughter.\"If they are dead, please God deliver them to me,\" she said.President Juan Manuel Santos made a second visit to the area on Sunday. He said water and energy services would be restored as soon as possible.Santos blamed climate change for the disaster, saying Mocoa had received one-third of its usual monthly rain in just one night, causing the rivers to burst their banks.There was disagreement over the death toll for most of Sunday but, late in the evening, the government's total was increased to match the 254-person figure released by the army. Just over 200 were injured. Disaster officials said more than 500 people were staying in emergency housing and social services had helped 10 lost children find their parents.The disaster came after deadly flooding in Peru killed more than 100 people and destroyed infrastructure.Families of the dead will receive about $6,400 in aid and the government will cover hospital and funeral costs.Even in a country where heavy rains, a mountainous landscape and informal construction combine to make landslides a common occurrence, the scale of the Mocoa disaster was daunting compared to recent tragedies, including a 2015 landslide that killed nearly 100 people. Colombia's deadliest landslide, the 1985 Armero disaster, killed more than 20,000 people.    Santos urged Colombians to take precautions against flooding and continued rains. The president also thanked China and the Inter-American Development Bank for donating $1 million and $200,000 respectively toward relief efforts.

FRAUD ALLEGATIONS Lasso, who had proclaimed himself victorious based on a top pollster's exit poll, disputed the close results that would extend a decade-long leftist rule in oil-rich Ecuador. \"They've crossed a line,\" he told supporters in a hotel in his coastal hometown of Guayaquil on Sunday, vowing to challenge the results, a complex process that could take time. \"We're going to defend the will of the Ecuadorean people in the face of this fraud attempt,\" he said.Lasso tweeted photos showing what he said were original votes for him that were changed by electoral officials. The election authority denied fraud allegations.Lasso contrasted Sunday's quickly tallied vote with the first round in February, when the results took days to come out.Hundreds of his supporters swarmed in front of electoral council offices in the capital, Quito, and Guayaquil, waving yellow, blue and red Ecuadorean flags and chanting \"No to fraud!\" and \"We don't want to be Venezuela!\" There were reports of isolated clashes on Sunday night, but protests ebbed as the night went on. \"This is shameless fraud, we all know it,\" said taxi driver Roberto Vera, 50, on Monday. \"They're from the Venezuelan school, that's their governance model and it will do great harm to all Ecuadoreans.\"But ruling Country Alliance officials scoffed that Lasso was a sore loser and inciting violence. Going forward, Moreno's party has control of Congress, but he will need to cultivate support from many in the polarized country who view his narrow win with suspicion. 'LENIN PRESIDENT!'Moreno, who lost the use of his legs two decades ago when he was shot during a robbery, would become a rare head of state to use a wheelchair when he takes office on May 24. \"Lenin,\" as he is commonly referred to by his supporters, celebrated in mountainous Quito overnight with the flag-waving crowd chanting, \"Lenin President!\"\"We're going to keep building the path. We've done a lot but there's a lot more to do!\" he said, flanked by running mate and current vice president, Jorge Glas, as well as beaming outgoing President Rafael Correa. He broke into several songs, including one about Argentine revolutionary hero Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. Moreno, a former U.N. special envoy on disability and accessibility, has a more conciliatory style than the fiery Correa and has promised benefits for single mothers, the elderly, and disabled Ecuadoreans.He will be under pressure to create jobs and crack down on graft amid corruption scandals at state-run oil company PetroEcuador and Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht [ODBES.UL].Lasso has criticized Moreno as being ill-equipped to deal with economic issues and warned that his major social promises would hit already pressured coffers in a country dependent on exports of oil, bananas, and shrimp. \"Moreno's margin of victory was much smaller than those of his predecessor Rafael Correa, leaving him in a much weaker spot,\" said John Polga, a political scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy. \"He has the advantage of a legislative majority (for now), but his government will have to confront fiscal restraints, a stagnant economy, and the burden of a recovery from last April's earthquake.\" (Additional reporting by Yury Garcia, Daniel Tapia, and Henry Romero in Guayaquil and Jose Llangari and Mariana Bazo in Quito; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Jeffrey Benkoe)"},
{"Link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN1740MX", "Title": "Venezuela opposition turns ire on Supreme Court judges", "Author": "Andrew Cawthorne", "Timestamp": "Sun Apr 2, 2017 | 6:22pm EDT", "Content": "CARACAS Venezuela's opposition lawmakers said on Sunday they will push for the removal of Supreme Court judges whom they accuse of acting on behalf of the ruling Socialists after the top tribunal briefly assumed control of congress last week. While the move by the opposition-led congress would only be symbolic because it remains powerless, it could add to pressure on unpopular president Nicolas Maduro as he tries to defuse the furor over what critics saw as a lurch into dictatorship. The Supreme Court's ruling last week that it would take over functions of the National Assembly triggered international condemnation and opposition protests at home. Even the country's attorney general, a longtime government ally, said the decision was unconstitutional in a rare public rebuke from Maduro's ranks. On Saturday, at the request of the government, the Supreme Court eliminated the offending ruling. But Maduro opponents said no one should believe that row- back meant democracy had been restored in the nation of 30 million people with the world's largest oil reserves. \"Despite a supposed retraction by the government after creating a coup d'etat, and apart from the clarification by the Supreme Court, the coup persists,\" lawmaker Juan Matheus said on behalf of the opposition.\"The rupture of the constitutional order continues,\" he added at a news conference inside the legislative building, flanked by pro-opposition legal and constitutional experts.Matheus said they will begin proceedings to remove the judges on Tuesday but he did not give further details.Since the opposition won a majority in congress in late 2015, the court has issued a raft of rulings backing Maduro and overturning most of the assembly's measures, meaning legislators remain effectively powerless.Maduro, who narrowly won election to replace his late mentor Hugo Chavez in 2013, said any constitutional controversy is over after he convened a special security committee over the weekend that instructed the Supreme Court to rectify the ruling. \"Every country has its problems and resolves them peacefully, constitutionally,\" he said on his weekly television show, \"Sundays With Maduro,\" adding that the government's resolution of the crisis had been \"impeccable.\"He has sought to portray himself as a statesman above a conflict between institutions, but critics said he and the ruling Socialist Party were pulling the strings on judicial bodies stuffed with stalwarts.Stung by the international outcry, including an unprecedented wave of statements from around Latin America, Maduro alleged he is the victim of a U.S.-led smear campaign intended to lay the groundwork for a coup against him.\"Venezuela demands respect from the entire world in order to continue living in peace. Nobody need get involved in Venezuelan issues,\" Maduro added.OAS DEBATES VENEZUELAMaduro's far more popular predecessor Chavez, who ruled Venezuela from 1999-2013 before dying of cancer, was briefly toppled in a 2002 coup but came back 36 hours later when supporters poured onto the streets and military factions came to his aid. Critics said it is not only the sidelining of an elected body, but also the jailing of scores of opponents, postponement of local elections last year and thwarting of a referendum on Maduro that evidence Venezuela's democratic erosion. Socialist Party officials, who were proud of the legitimacy bestowed by constant election wins under Chavez, have detailed their justifications for all those actions, saying opponents have broken the law and used fraud in the 2016 referendum drive.  While attention often focuses on the headline-grabbing polemics between opposition and government, analysts believe any potential near-term change may come instead from ruptures within the administration or a nudge from the powerful military.Foreign pressure is mounting too. Under Chavez, Venezuela led a resurgent leftist bloc in Latin America, but shifts to the right in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Paraguay have changed that dynamic. The Organization of American States (OAS), whose head Luis Almagro is a hate figure for Maduro's government and wants it suspended from the bloc, was due to meet on Monday to debate Venezuela. The week's events have seen instability re-emerge on the streets of Venezuela, with pockets of protesters clashing with security forces who have fired teargas several times.There appears to be little appetite within the opposition for renewed mass rallies which have failed time and time again during the nearly two-decade rule of the socialists.The opposition's main demand is for the next presidential election, slated for December 2018, to be brought forward.Maduro, a former bus driver, foreign minister and self-declared \"son\" of Chavez, was elected with around 50 percent approval ratings, but has seen those plummet during an economic crisis.Basic foods and medicines are often scarce, inflation is the highest in the world and there are long lines at many shops. Critics blame a failing socialist system, while the government says its enemies are waging an economic war. The fall in oil prices since mid-2014 has exacerbated the crisis.

PETERSBURG, Russia At least nine people were killed and 20 were injured when an explosion tore through a train carriage in the St. Petersburg metro system on Monday, the Russian National Anti-Terrorist Committee said.Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying the blast, which occurred when the train was between two stations, was caused by a bomb filled with shrapnel.President Vladimir Putin, who was in the city for a meeting with Belarus's leader, said he was considering all possible causes for the blast, including terrorism and was consulting with security services.Ambulances and fire engines descended on the concrete-and-glass Sennaya Ploshchad metro station. A helicopter hovered overhead as crowds gathered to observe rescue operations.\"I appeal to you citizens of St. Petersburg and guests of our city to be alert, attentive and cautious and to behave in a responsible matter in light of events,\" St Petersburg Governor Georgy Poltavchenko said in an address.An attack on St Petersburg, Russia's old imperial capital, would have some symbolic force for any militant group, especially Islamic State or Chechen secessionist rebels. Attacks in the past have largely concentrated on Moscow, including an attack on an airport, a theater and in 2010 a metro train.Video showed injured people lying bleeding on a platform, some being treated by emergency services and fellow passengers. Others ran away from the platform amid clouds of smoke, some screaming or holding their hands to their faces.A huge hole was blown open in the side of a carriage with  metal wreckage strewn across the platform. Passengers were seen hammering at the windows of one closed carriage. Russian TV said many had suffered lacerations from glass shards and metal.Russia has been the target of attacks by separatist Islamist Chechen militants in past years. Islamic State, which has drawn recruits from the ranks of Chechen rebels, has also threatened attacks across Russia in retaliation for Russian military intervention in Syria.The Russian air force and special forces have been supporting President Bashar al-Assad in fighting rebel groups and Islamic State fighters now being driven out of their Syrian strongholds.ALL STATIONS CLOSEDSt. Petersburg emergency services at first said that there had been two explosions. But a source in the emergency services later said that there had been only one but that the explosion had occurred in a tunnel between stations.The blast occurred at 2.40 p.m., well shy of the evening rush hour.Authorities closed all St. Petersburg metro stations. The Moscow metro said it was taking unspecified additional security measures in case of an attack there. Russia has been on particular alert against Chechen rebels returning from Syria and wary of any attempts to resume attacks that dogged the country several years ago.At least 38 people were killed in 2010 when two female suicide bombers detonated bombs on packed Moscow metro trains.Over 330 people, half of them children, were killed in 2004 when police stormed a school in southern Russia after a hostage taking by Islamist militants. In 2002, 120 hostages were killed when police stormed a Moscow theater to end another hostage-taking.Putin, as prime minister, launched a 1999 campaign to crush a separatist government in the Muslim southern region of Chechnya, and as president continued a hard line in suppressing rebellion.

The technology company has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the iPod and receives a small royalty on every graphics chip used in a device.Imagination, however, said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead.\"This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it,\" said the British company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Imagination's shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel (INTC.O) bought stakes. The company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in April 2012.It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints.Imagination says it has 50 percent of the high-end smartphone market, but only 7 percent of mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to regain market share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers.It said that Apple's notification had triggered talks on alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement.Analysts said there could be room for a compromise, and it could be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties. Apple paid Imagination license fees and royalties totaling 60.7 million pounds for the year to end-April 2016, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about 65 million pounds for this year, Imagination said.Most of its costs are incurred designing new technology years ahead of when it appears in devices, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with the Apple revenue.

The Baltic states have previously said they would press the United States and NATO to take additional security measures in the region ahead of the exercises.Intelligence officers said disinformation aimed at discrediting NATO soldiers stationed in Lithuania, such as a recent false report of a rape by German soldiers, was likely to persist.\"Provocations against NATO units in Lithuania will continue and will get bigger,\" Remigijus Baltrenas, head of Lithuanian military counterintelligence, told reporters.

Whiff of jingoism amid talk of blue passports and war", "Author": "Guy Faulconbridge", "Timestamp": "Mon Apr 3, 2017 | 9:45am EDT", "Content": "LONDON Just days after Prime Minister Theresa May formally served the European Union with divorce papers, a powerful affliction appeared to strike some in Britain: Brexit fever.Amid a row with Spain and the EU over the status of Gibraltar, a former leader of May's Conservative party, Michael Howard, even said she would be prepared to go to war to defend the small British territory near Spain's southern tip.Beside headlines about war over \"the Rock\" in Britain's Euroskeptic press, there was also enthusiasm for an as yet unconfirmed plan to ditch European burgundy passports and return to the sturdy blue British passports of the past.Readers of the Daily Telegraph were told that while the once mighty Royal Navy was weaker than it used to be, it could still \"cripple\" Spain if required.A columnist in The Sun suggested May should threaten to expel all 125,000 Spaniards from Britain and tax Rioja wine unless Madrid backed off over Gibraltar, ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 but which Spain wants back.So is Brexit fever sweeping Britain?\"Some people are getting a bit overexcited and I would take everything that was said over the weekend with a massive pinch of salt,\" Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College in London, told Reuters.The prime minister, an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the political turmoil that followed the referendum, now has two years to sort out the terms of the divorce before it comes into effect in March 2019.May, 60, has one of the toughest tasks of any recent British prime minister: holding Britain together in the face of renewed Scottish independence demands, while conducting talks with 27 other EU states on finance, trade, security and other issues.May's spokesman sought to calm matters down, saying that what Howard \"was trying to establish was the resolve that we will have to protect the rights of Gibraltar and its sovereignty\". Asked if that would include ultimately sending a naval task force to protect Gibraltar as Britain did to the Falklands 35 years ago, he said: \"That isn\u2019t going to happen.\"\"RED, WHITE AND BLUE BREXIT\"The Daily Mail carried a factbox on \"Who's got the biggest armada?\" while praising putting the blue passport back into \"a red, white and BLUE Brexit\".But the belligerent mood, shared by only a section of British society, could also have a more serious impact on the course of Brexit, according to Menon.\"If the talks break down over money or trade or whatever and the mood music is perfidious Europe, then it makes it a lot easier for the prime minister to deflect blame and hold a snap red, white and blue election,\" said Menon.\"It also arguably makes it harder for May to compromise over Brexit,\" he said.The outcome of the negotiations will shape the future of Britain's economy, the world's fifth biggest, and determine whether London can keep remain one of the top two global financial centers.For the EU, already reeling from successive crises over debt and refugees, the loss of Britain is the biggest blow yet to 60 years of efforts to forge European unity after two world wars.In Britain, though, the mood was jubilant - and at times bordering on the surreal.Another piece in the Telegraph called for the return of Britain's \"imperial\" units - confusing ancient weights and measures which sit alongside the metric system: Beer is served in pints but petrol in liters.Kelvin MacKenzie, a columnist who edited the Sun newspaper from 1981 to 1994, had strong words for Spain.\"We are only just into these Brexit negotiations and to be honest I have already gone from jaw-jaw to war-war,\" he wrote. \"Our friends in Europe are quickly turning out to be our foes. It\u2019s only in recent history where Germany and Italy have been on our side.\" (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Giles Elgood)"},

PETERSBURG, Russia At least nine people were killed and 20 were injured when an explosion tore through a train carriage in the St. Petersburg metro system on Monday, the Russian National Anti-Terrorist Committee said.Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying the blast, which occurred when the train was between two stations, was caused by a bomb filled with shrapnel.President Vladimir Putin, who was in the city for a meeting with Belarus's leader, said he was considering all possible causes for the blast, including terrorism and was consulting with security services.Ambulances and fire engines descended on the concrete-and-glass Sennaya Ploshchad metro station. A helicopter hovered overhead as crowds gathered to observe rescue operations.\"I appeal to you citizens of St. Petersburg and guests of our city to be alert, attentive and cautious and to behave in a responsible matter in light of events,\" St Petersburg Governor Georgy Poltavchenko said in an address.An attack on St Petersburg, Russia's old imperial capital, would have some symbolic force for any militant group, especially Islamic State or Chechen secessionist rebels. Attacks in the past have largely concentrated on Moscow, including an attack on an airport, a theater and in 2010 a metro train.Video showed injured people lying bleeding on a platform, some being treated by emergency services and fellow passengers. Others ran away from the platform amid clouds of smoke, some screaming or holding their hands to their faces.A huge hole was blown open in the side of a carriage with  metal wreckage strewn across the platform. Passengers were seen hammering at the windows of one closed carriage. Russian TV said many had suffered lacerations from glass shards and metal.Russia has been the target of attacks by separatist Islamist Chechen militants in past years. Islamic State, which has drawn recruits from the ranks of Chechen rebels, has also threatened attacks across Russia in retaliation for Russian military intervention in Syria.The Russian air force and special forces have been supporting President Bashar al-Assad in fighting rebel groups and Islamic State fighters now being driven out of their Syrian strongholds.ALL STATIONS CLOSEDSt. Petersburg emergency services at first said that there had been two explosions. But a source in the emergency services later said that there had been only one but that the explosion had occurred in a tunnel between stations.The blast occurred at 2.40 p.m., well shy of the evening rush hour.Authorities closed all St. Petersburg metro stations. The Moscow metro said it was taking unspecified additional security measures in case of an attack there. Russia has been on particular alert against Chechen rebels returning from Syria and wary of any attempts to resume attacks that dogged the country several years ago.At least 38 people were killed in 2010 when two female suicide bombers detonated bombs on packed Moscow metro trains.Over 330 people, half of them children, were killed in 2004 when police stormed a school in southern Russia after a hostage taking by Islamist militants. In 2002, 120 hostages were killed when police stormed a Moscow theater to end another hostage-taking.Putin, as prime minister, launched a 1999 campaign to crush a separatist government in the Muslim southern region of Chechnya, and as president continued a hard line in suppressing rebellion.

Republicans hold a 11-9 majority on the committee, which held a four-day confirmation hearing last month, and control the Senate by a 52-48 margin.The committee's chairman, Republican Chuck Grassley, defended Gorsuch as a mainstream jurist worthy of confirmation despite the complaints of many Democrats, and that \"there isn't a whole lot of mystery\" that the panel will approve the nomination.\"Over the last couple months, the nominee's opponents have tried to find fault with him. That fault will not stick,\" Grassley said.Democrats are planning to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster that requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to cut off debate and allow a confirmation vote. The actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped.So far, 37 Democrats have backed such a move. To date, three Democrats have said they support Gorsuch, and the Republicans would have to secure eight Democratic votes to kill a filibuster.If confirmed to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch, 49, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, would restore the nine-seat high court's conservative majority, fulfilling one of Trump's top campaign promises.Republican Senate leaders insist Gorsuch will be confirmed on Friday regardless of what the Democrats do.\"What I can tell you is Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed this week. How that happens really depends on our Democratic friends,\" Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that it was \"highly, highly unlikely\" that Republicans would get 60 votes.If Republicans cannot win over eight Democrats, McConnell could force a vote by changing long-standing Senate rules to allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, a move sometimes called the \"nuclear option\" that Trump has urged.While Gorsuch's opponents would fight such a rule change, it was the Democrats who in 2013 changed the Senate rules to limit filibusters after Republican use of the procedure against nominees selected by Democratic former President Barack Obama. The Senate, then led by Democrats, barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices.Many Democrats have accused Republicans of \"stealing\" a Supreme Court seat because the Republican-led Senate refused last year to consider Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee who opposes Gorsuch, spoke out against any potential deal in the Senate in which Democrats would agree not to filibuster Gorsuch if Republicans agreed to maintain the 60-vote super-majority for the next Supreme Court nominee.\"I will not accept a deal that preserves the 60-vote threshold at the cost of having on the court someone who refuses to say whether he agrees with core constitutional precepts protecting privacy, equality under the law, and protections for workers and consumers, and clean air and water,\" Blumenthal told MSNBC.Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, also a member of the committee, said he would support using the \"nuclear option\" to overcome Democratic objections to Gorsuch but hoped such a move would not be necessary.\"This is a guy who's a mainstream conservative,\" Hatch told CNN, adding that Democrats were seeking payback over Republicans' blocking of Garland.\"We can't let them just stop one of the best nominees ever nominated to the Supreme Court because their far left constituencies are screaming and shouting,\" Hatch said.Republicans have defended Gorsuch as well qualified for the lifetime job as a Supreme Court justice and praised his performance during the confirmation hearings. Democrats have accused Gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of Trump, evading questions on key Supreme Court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending, and favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans.Gorsuch, if confirmed, would immediately be thrust into the high court's current term, which runs from October to June. If he is confirmed on Friday, he would be able to participate in the court's next round of oral arguments in pending cases, starting on April 17.

Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd (600600.SS), China's number two brewer, posted its steepest drop in net profit in 20 years last week, blaming tough competition and weak demand. Noodle maker Tingyi (0322.HK) saw profits drop by a third.China's top cinema operator Wanda Cinema Line (002739.SZ) saw 2016 profits rise 15.2 percent - down from growth of nearly 50 percent the year before, as broader box office sales stalled. IMAX China's (1970.HK) profit tumbled, too.  \"There's still a tonne of room for growth, but these markets are much more competitive now and even bigger brands are starting to struggle,\" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.\"Consumers are becoming more cagey about how they're spending their money, (from) food to clothing and movies.\"Increased caution - and sophistication - will push companies to innovate, and to spend more to fend off competitors, if they are to survive, analysts said.After growing at the slowest pace in 26 years in 2016, official data have indicated a strong start to the economy this year, supported by bank lending, a government infrastructure spree and a much-needed resurgence in private investment.But China's consumption trends have been less clear.Retail sales in December rose at their fastest pace in a year, thanks to cars and cosmetics, but they disappointed in the first two months of this year.Consumption contributed the bulk of China's growth last year at nearly 65 percent, but income growth didn't pick up, and a measure of China's income inequality rose slightly last year.A private business survey last month showed growth in the services sector slowed to a four-month low as increasing competition made it harder for companies to pass higher input costs on to consumers.To be sure, the picture from recent earnings reports is not comprehensive nor uniform.But the drop in profits of some of China's best-known names flags the uneven nature of the country's gradual shift to a consumer-driven economy, and the challenge for both brands and Beijing, which needs to stoke domestic consumption and private investment to fuel growth.Of course there were bright spots.In areas like sports apparel, firms such as Li Ning Co Ltd (2331.HK) and ANTA Sports (2020.HK) predicted a boost as China looks to build its sports industry and consumers become increasingly health conscious. Li Ning's profits rose sharply.But global uncertainties - from the impact of trade policies under new U.S. President Donald Trump to political uncertainty in Europe - are expected to cloud the year.\"In 2017, great uncertainties in the economic outlook remain in view of the changes in political and economic policies in some key regions,\" China Resources Beer (0291.HK) said.The brewer reported sluggish sales growth, but also its first annual profit in three years this month.Retailers also reported a mixed outlook, although a slowdown in e-commerce was creating opportunities elsewhere.White goods maker Qingdao Haier (600690.SS), which posted annual net profit growth of 3.1 percent, said China was in a new normal of consumer growth - but expects sales to eventually accelerate with rising salaries and demand for high-tech homes.Others bore the cost of change: home appliance retailer GOME (0493.HK) posted a 73 percent drop in full-year profit as it spent on a strategic shake-up.\"Looking into 2017, it is expected that (the Chinese) and global economy will continue to face downward pressure, leading to sluggish market demand,\" said Chairman Li Dongsheng of television maker TCL Multimedia (1070.HK).

Many family-run factories and food processing plants were severely damaged, dealing a devastating blow to the local economy in the area famous for its Parmesan cheese and Parma prosciutto.The rebuilding plan has been held up as exemplary to other Italian regions because it brought together business leaders, the Church and politicians to decide priorities.To restore the economy, they decided that factories would be restored first, followed by homes and schools. Cultural heritage sites such as churches were fixed last. The Carpi cathedral reopened last week.A series of strong earthquake hit the central regions of Lazio, Marche and Umbria last year, killing more than 300 people.

Russia has so far refused to return the wreckage of the jet to Poland, a member of NATO and the European Union, citing its own continuing investigation. The accusations of the Polish prosecutors, whom the PiS brought under direct government control, are likely to worsen relations with Moscow - already strained over the conflict in Ukraine - and increase tensions within Polish society.The previous Polish government's report indicated that Smolensk traffic controllers unintentionally contributed to the crash, charges Moscow had dismissed as false. A Russian report into the crash puts the blame squarely on the Poles.The Polish prosecutors said on Monday that a re-opening of the victims' coffins, which had been sealed in Russia, has revealed that in two cases remains were in the wrong coffins and in five coffins there were fragments of other bodies.The crash was the worst such disaster in Poland since World War Two and left society deeply divided over its causes. A transcript of conversations from the plane's cockpit leaked by Polish media in 2015 showed that members of the president's entourage urged the pilots to land despite heavy fog.But many Poles were shocked with video footage showing Russian workers pushing around large parts of the wreckage with excavators, cutting cables and carelessly throwing smaller pieces into a heap on a truck.

Mainland markets were closed for a two-day public holiday.Worried about runaway prices, the government slapped an emergency ban on property sales in Xiongxian and Anxin counties, forcing real estate agents to shut and frustrating would-be investors.Officials took to the streets to blast warnings through loudspeakers against illegal speculating.In Xiongxian on Monday, the doors to the Anju property company were sealed by tape declaring \"Shut by the government on April 2\", while workers dismantled the brown and white store sign for the Qianju real estate company.Still, social media was abuzz about the astonishing price rally and investors' appetite even before Beijing had laid out concrete details of the development plan.    \"Housing prices have jumped even before companies and people have committed (to the zone). Does any company dare to invest there after property prices soared?\" posted one Weibo user using the name Roumando.The frenzy underscores Beijing's challenge as it seeks to crack down on speculators, which have whipsawed prices of equities, commodities and property in recent years, and cool a red-hot real estate market.Prospective buyers appeared undeterred on Monday.A couple were in Anxin checking out property after driving from Tangshan, about 250 km east of the new zone.

While the Mexican currency has gained some 17 percent against the dollar since the inauguration of Donald Trump as U.S. president in January, fund managers say the currency is still undervalued even as it moves below 19 pesos per dollar. That means that Mexico - long a reasonably priced destination for Americans - remains cheap, potentially further boosting a strong inflow of tourists.The\u00a0number of\u00a0international tourists in Mexico\u00a0climbed\u00a09 percent to 35 million in 2016, a year in which the dollar gained around 20 percent against the peso, according to Mexican Tourism Ministry figures.  A January OECD report linked the growth to \"sharp depreciation of the Mexican peso,\" which had \"improved the price competitiveness of tourism exports in Mexico's main source markets, particularly in the important U.S. market.\"Moody's Investors Service said in a report late last year that it expected further growth in 2017, thanks to a reduction in fuel prices, a strong dollar and increased competition among airlines.A continued tourism upswing could benefit Grupo Posadas, a Mexican hotel operator, as well as Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico, S.A.B. de C.V. (GAPB.MX), a holding company that operates international airports in the Pacific and Central regions of Mexico and in Jamaica, both of whose bonds Aberdeen Asset Management's emerging market debt fund owns.\"For American tourists ... it's cheaper for them to go on holiday now and we don't think Trump's policies are going to prevent the marginal person in the U.S. from going on holiday in Cancun,\" said Kathy Collins, Aberdeen's emerging market debt investment manager.TOURISM SHINESLoomis Sayles' emerging markets co-portfolio manager Eddy Sternberg is also betting on Grupo Posadas, part of the firm's overweight position in Mexican corporate debt, noting that \"with all the Mexican peso depreciation, tourism is doing fabulously.\"Grupo Posadas' dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2022 have seen their yields drop 111 basis points since the U.S. inauguration and their spread over comparable U.S. Treasuries compress 85 basis points during that time.Aberdeen's Collins favored the tourism sector over others like industrial real estate that she believes could be more affected by Mexican and U.S. political developments. Similarly, Loomis Sayles' Sternberg recently reduced his holdings of Mexican banks because of how exposed they were to Mexico's domestic economy. Of course, foreign demand is not the only factor contributing to strength in Mexican travel and tourism. Aaron Visse, who co-manages asset management firm Salient's Dividend Signal Strategy portfolios, which focus on emerging market infrastructure investments, said population growth and the emergence of a middle class in Mexico had encouraged him to buy stock in airports, including Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB CV (ASURB.MX) and Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico.Both companies were privatized in the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of a plan to put the airport industry, which operates based on long-term concessions handed out by the government, in the hands of private enterprise.ASR's American depositary receipts have surged 150 percent over the past 5 years compared with 67 percent for the benchmark S&P; 500 equity index .SPX. Meanwhile, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico has more than quadrupled over the same period, far outpacing the 22 percent gain in Mexico's benchmark IPC index .MXX during the same period. \"These things have been really compelling long-term, total return stories and I think they\u2019re really exciting assets in markets like Mexico and others where you\u2019re going to continue to see population growth and more emergence of a middle class,\" Visse said.

The company, which took the perfume business back in house in 2013, said it would retain creative control while Coty, which counts Gucci, Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein in its portfolio, would bring its global distribution network to the table.Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said Burberry had repositioned the business by cutting secondary-channel sales, and it was now time to team up to develop it further.\"Coty has very broad experience of working closely with other luxury brands,\" she said in an interview. \"We will benefit from their deep beauty industry expertise and also their first-class distribution.\"Coty will pay 130 million pounds ($163 million) for the long-term license, plus about 50 million pounds for inventory and other assets, Burberry said. It will also pay royalties from October.Beauty contributed 7 percent of Burberry's revenue in the first half of its 2016/17 financial year, down 17 percent on the prior period, partly as a result of the repositioning.It launched men's fragrance Mr Burberry a year ago and young British model Iris Law has promoted its cosmetics.Chief Operating Officer John Smith said there was an opportunity to increase cosmetics sales, which currently account for about 8 percent of beauty sales against an industry average of a third.\"Make-up is a key recruitment tool for a luxury brand, in that the price points are a lot lower than any other product,\" he said. \"As a means of recruiting people into the brand, it's perfect.\" Shares in Burberry were trading up 1 percent at 1,739 pence at 1306 GMT (9:06 a.m. ET).Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said they welcomed the decision to find a partner to develop the beauty business.\"In fact, we never liked the idea of Burberry managing its beauty business directly, as beauty is an FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) business where you win on the back of global reach,\" they said.Burberry said the deal would be broadly neutral to adjusted profit before tax in 2017/18 and accretive the following year.

His (Mladic's) long history as a fugitive from justice and the severity of the charges against him demonstrate the risk he would abscond prior to judgment,\" the prosecution document said.Mladic was gravely ill when he arrived at the U.N. court in The Hague after years on the run, prosecutors said. \"The medical treatment that followed, as he explicitly acknowledged, saved his life,\" they said.The medical issues in Mladic's case echoed those of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in his cell in 2006 of a heart attack before his verdict on genocide charges.Milosevic had made a similar request for provisional release to receive medical treatment in Russia a month earlier.Mladic, 75, is awaiting judgment after a four-year trial on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in an ethnic cleansing campaign in Bosnia that saw the 1995 genocide of thousands of Muslim men and boys from Srebrenica.

Vucic made clear his change of job would not alter the former Yugoslav republic's geopolitical balance between the European Union, which Vucic wants Serbia to join, and Russia, with which Serbs share their Orthodox Christian faith and Slavic heritage.He thanked German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, both of whom he met during the election campaign.\"For me it is important this election demonstrated that a large majority of Serbian citizens favors the continuation of the European path while maintaining close ties with China and Russia,\" Vucic told cheering supporters.     Despite economic growth and greater fiscal stability, Serbia remains mired in poverty and corruption. But to his supporters, Vucic is a firm hand in a troubled region.\"I voted for stability, we've had enough wars,\" said Bozica Ivanovic, a 65-year-old pensioner who voted for Vucic. \"We need more jobs for younger people and if we can get higher pensions and salaries, even better.\"'HYPOCRISY'Vucic's opponents, however, say he has an authoritarian streak that has led him to take control over the media in Serbia since his party rose to power in 2012 and he became prime minister three years ago. He denies the charge but has struggled to shake it given his record when last in government in the dying days of Yugoslavia. Then in his late 20s, Vucic was Serbia's feared information minister behind draconian legislation designed to muzzle criticism of the government during the 1998-99 Kosovo war.\"If there's no second round, that means we live in a society that is politically immature,\" sociologist Jovo Bakic told N1 television. \"Where else do you not get a second round? In North Korea.\"Twenty-five-year-old student Luka Maksimovic, who ran as a white-suited parody of a sleazy political fraudster called Ljubisa \"Beli\" Preletacevic, came third with just over nine percent, picking up the votes of Serbs disillusioned with the country's political class.\"I voted for Beli,\" said 30-year-old Dejan Markovic, an unemployed metal worker. \"The so-called opposition candidates have betrayed us in the past and Vucic is lying to us all now, so Beli is the only way to mock all this hypocrisy.\"As president, Vucic will have few formal powers, among them the right to send legislation back to parliament for reconsideration. But he is widely expected to appoint a loyal ally as prime minister and try to keep a tight rein on policy, as former President Boris Tadic, then of the Democratic Party, did between 2004 and 2012.Some analysts said that could prove difficult.\"Vucic will now be distanced from everyday policy-making and executive affairs and will have to rely on a proxy,\" Eurasia Group wrote on March 30. \"This will likely generate some tensions in the chain of command.\" (Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Ralph Boulton and Meredith Mazzilli)"},

Whiff of jingoism amid talk of blue passports and war", "Author": "Guy Faulconbridge", "Timestamp": "Mon Apr 3, 2017 | 9:45am EDT", "Content": "LONDON Just days after Prime Minister Theresa May formally served the European Union with divorce papers, a powerful affliction appeared to strike some in Britain: Brexit fever.Amid a row with Spain and the EU over the status of Gibraltar, a former leader of May's Conservative party, Michael Howard, even said she would be prepared to go to war to defend the small British territory near Spain's southern tip.Beside headlines about war over \"the Rock\" in Britain's Euroskeptic press, there was also enthusiasm for an as yet unconfirmed plan to ditch European burgundy passports and return to the sturdy blue British passports of the past.Readers of the Daily Telegraph were told that while the once mighty Royal Navy was weaker than it used to be, it could still \"cripple\" Spain if required.A columnist in The Sun suggested May should threaten to expel all 125,000 Spaniards from Britain and tax Rioja wine unless Madrid backed off over Gibraltar, ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 but which Spain wants back.So is Brexit fever sweeping Britain?\"Some people are getting a bit overexcited and I would take everything that was said over the weekend with a massive pinch of salt,\" Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College in London, told Reuters.The prime minister, an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the political turmoil that followed the referendum, now has two years to sort out the terms of the divorce before it comes into effect in March 2019.May, 60, has one of the toughest tasks of any recent British prime minister: holding Britain together in the face of renewed Scottish independence demands, while conducting talks with 27 other EU states on finance, trade, security and other issues.May's spokesman sought to calm matters down, saying that what Howard \"was trying to establish was the resolve that we will have to protect the rights of Gibraltar and its sovereignty\". Asked if that would include ultimately sending a naval task force to protect Gibraltar as Britain did to the Falklands 35 years ago, he said: \"That isn\u2019t going to happen.\"\"RED, WHITE AND BLUE BREXIT\"The Daily Mail carried a factbox on \"Who's got the biggest armada?\" while praising putting the blue passport back into \"a red, white and BLUE Brexit\".But the belligerent mood, shared by only a section of British society, could also have a more serious impact on the course of Brexit, according to Menon.\"If the talks break down over money or trade or whatever and the mood music is perfidious Europe, then it makes it a lot easier for the prime minister to deflect blame and hold a snap red, white and blue election,\" said Menon.\"It also arguably makes it harder for May to compromise over Brexit,\" he said.The outcome of the negotiations will shape the future of Britain's economy, the world's fifth biggest, and determine whether London can keep remain one of the top two global financial centers.For the EU, already reeling from successive crises over debt and refugees, the loss of Britain is the biggest blow yet to 60 years of efforts to forge European unity after two world wars.In Britain, though, the mood was jubilant - and at times bordering on the surreal.Another piece in the Telegraph called for the return of Britain's \"imperial\" units - confusing ancient weights and measures which sit alongside the metric system: Beer is served in pints but petrol in liters.Kelvin MacKenzie, a columnist who edited the Sun newspaper from 1981 to 1994, had strong words for Spain.\"We are only just into these Brexit negotiations and to be honest I have already gone from jaw-jaw to war-war,\" he wrote. \"Our friends in Europe are quickly turning out to be our foes.

Many family-run factories and food processing plants were severely damaged, dealing a devastating blow to the local economy in the area famous for its Parmesan cheese and Parma prosciutto.The rebuilding plan has been held up as exemplary to other Italian regions because it brought together business leaders, the Church and politicians to decide priorities.To restore the economy, they decided that factories would be restored first, followed by homes and schools. Cultural heritage sites such as churches were fixed last. The Carpi cathedral reopened last week.A series of strong earthquake hit the central regions of Lazio, Marche and Umbria last year, killing more than 300 people. Critics says reconstruction plans have been bogged down in those areas because of bickering over priorities. (Reporting By Philip Pullella; editing by Clelia Oziel)"},

Russia has so far refused to return the wreckage of the jet to Poland, a member of NATO and the European Union, citing its own continuing investigation. The accusations of the Polish prosecutors, whom the PiS brought under direct government control, are likely to worsen relations with Moscow - already strained over the conflict in Ukraine - and increase tensions within Polish society.The previous Polish government's report indicated that Smolensk traffic controllers unintentionally contributed to the crash, charges Moscow had dismissed as false. A Russian report into the crash puts the blame squarely on the Poles.The Polish prosecutors said on Monday that a re-opening of the victims' coffins, which had been sealed in Russia, has revealed that in two cases remains were in the wrong coffins and in five coffins there were fragments of other bodies.The crash was the worst such disaster in Poland since World War Two and left society deeply divided over its causes. A transcript of conversations from the plane's cockpit leaked by Polish media in 2015 showed that members of the president's entourage urged the pilots to land despite heavy fog.But many Poles were shocked with video footage showing Russian workers pushing around large parts of the wreckage with excavators, cutting cables and carelessly throwing smaller pieces into a heap on a truck. The crash took place as pilots attempted to land a Soviet-made TU-154 at a rarely used airport near Smolensk to take part in commemorations of 22,000 Polish officers executed there by Soviet secret police in 1940.

The company, which took the perfume business back in house in 2013, said it would retain creative control while Coty, which counts Gucci, Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein in its portfolio, would bring its global distribution network to the table.Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said Burberry had repositioned the business by cutting secondary-channel sales, and it was now time to team up to develop it further.\"Coty has very broad experience of working closely with other luxury brands,\" she said in an interview. \"We will benefit from their deep beauty industry expertise and also their first-class distribution.\"Coty will pay 130 million pounds ($163 million) for the long-term license, plus about 50 million pounds for inventory and other assets, Burberry said.

Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he invited Kushner and Tom Bossert, White House homeland security adviser, to accompany him so they could hear \"first-hand and unfiltered\" from military advisers about the situation on the ground and interact with U.S. forces. \"I said, 'Hey, next time I go to Iraq, if you're interested, come and it\u2019d be good,\" Dunford said, adding he extended the invitation weeks ago. That kind of ground-level awareness of the war helps inform strategic decisions, Dunford said, adding it was the same reason he regularly leaves Washington to visit Iraq.\"The more appreciation you could have for what's actually happening on the ground, the more informed you are when you start talking about the strategic issues,\" Dunford said.Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, did not speak with reporters during the flight to Iraq.Dunford's spokesman, Navy Captain Greg Hicks, said Kushner was traveling on behalf of Trump to express the president's support and commitment to Iraq's government and U.S. personnel helping combat Islamic State.Trump, who campaigned on defeating Islamic State, has yet to announce any dramatic shift in war strategy. U.S. ROLE AFTER MOSUL FIGHT The trip to Iraq comes as Iraqi security forces engage in fierce, house-to-house fighting to retake Mosul, Islamic State's last major stronghold in Iraq and the city where leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate nearly three years ago.Nearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the United Nations. Although the loss of Mosul would deal a major defeat to Islamic State, U.S. and Iraqi officials are preparing for smaller battles even after the city is recaptured and expect the group to go underground to fight as a traditional insurgency.What happens to the U.S. military role in Iraq after Mosul is recaptured remain unclear. Influential Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has previously called on Iraq's government to order the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces after the battle of Mosul is over.Dunford said Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi understood the need for continued U.S. military support.\"It's not our judgment that the Iraqis will be self sustaining and self sufficient in the wake of Mosul. More importantly, it's not Prime Minister Abadi's assessment,\" Dunford said.Across the border in Syria, a U.S.-backed campaign to isolate Islamic State's de facto capital of Raqqa is advancing ahead of an eventual assault on the city. U.S.-backed Syrian forces repelled a major counter-attack by Islamic State militants holding out at the country's largest dam and in the nearby town of Tabqa, the group and activists said on Sunday. The dam is a strategic target in the military campaign, located about 40 km (25 miles) to the east of Raqqa.     (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Giles Elgood)"},

They are hoping to overturn a 2015 New York federal appeals court ruling that the bank could not be sued under the statute because it is a corporation.The Alien Tort Statute, a law dating back to 1789, lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in U.S. courts for human rights violations abroad. The lead plaintiff in the case is Joseph Jesner, whose British citizen son was killed at age 19 in a 2002 suicide bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv.The plaintiffs filed several lawsuits under the law in Brooklyn federal court, claiming Arab Bank used its New York branch to transfer money and \"serve as a 'paymaster' for international terrorists.\" The transfers helped Hamas and other groups fund attacks and reward families of the perpetrators between 1995 and 2005, the suits alleged. The bank said in court papers that the U.S. government has called it a constructive partner in the fight against terrorism financing. The bank said only four transactions out of 500,000 involved \"designated terrorists\" by the U.S. government, and they were the result of machine or human error. The bank also cited a separate 2010 case, Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum, in which the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that corporations cannot be sued under the Alien Tort Statute. After reviewing that case, the Supreme Court in 2013 narrowed the law's reach, saying claims must sufficiently \"touch and concern\" the United States to overcome the presumption that the Alien Tort Statute does not cover foreign conduct. But the high court declined to explicitly decide whether the 2nd Circuit ruling on corporate liability was correct. Based on the Kiobel ruling, the 2nd Circuit threw out the litigation against Arab Bank. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, urging it to decide once and for all whether or not corporations are shielded over foreign conduct.

Investigations were continuing. \"We understand Somali pirates hijacked a commercial Indian ship (and it is heading) toward Somalia shores,\" Abdirizak Mohamed Dirir, a former director of the anti-piracy agency in Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region, told Reuters.Somali pirates hijacked an oil tanker last month, the first such seizure of a vessel since 2012, but released it after a clash with the Puntland marine force.Somalis have been angered by a recent influx of foreign fishermen into their waters, some of whom have been given licenses to operate there by the Somali government.Graeme Gibbon-Brooks of UK-based Dryad Maritime Security said industry sources had told him the Indian vessel had been en route to Bosasso from Dubai when it was hijacked on Saturday. The pirates on board were taking the ship and its 11 crew members to Eyl in Puntland, he said.  Muse Osman Yusuf, Eyl's district commissioner, said authorities were ready to confront the pirates.\"We shall not allow it. Puntland maritime police forces have a base here and we shall fight the pirates in case they come,\" he told Reuters.An Indian government official said the 11 crew were all Indian and that officials were in touch with the Somali government.\"This confirms that the pirates still have the ability to go to sea and take vessels, and the international shipping industry needs to take additional precautions,\" John Steed of the aid group Oceans Beyond Piracy told Reuters.In 2011, pirates launched 237 attacks off the coast of Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau, and took hundreds of hostages.Shipping companies responded with security measures such as armed guards, blocking easy entry points to vessels with barbed wire and installing secure panic rooms. In a separate incident, UKMTO said on its website that early on Monday six skiffs had approached a vessel and that ladders and hooks were sighted.Armed guards on board the vessel took up positions and the skiffs departed, leaving the vessel unharmed, UKTMO said.

They provide background support for oil prices,\" the chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets Spooner said.Oil prices had rallied for three days last week, lifted by reduced Libyan output and helped by expectations that members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers such as Russia would extend production cuts beyond June.But in a sign investors were more cautious about further price gains, hedge funds and money managers cut net long positions last week by 28,942 contracts to 372,756 lots in the week to March 28, the lowest since Nov. 29, data released by the InterContinental Exchange showed.

Surveys on Monday also showed encouraging growth in Europe, Japan, India and much of emerging Asia.In the euro zone, IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to its highly in nearly six-year high of 56.2 in March, far above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.However, British manufacturers lost some momentum last month, as export orders grew more slowly and rising inflation cut into consumer demand.Sterling's tumble following June's vote to leave the European Union helped manufacturers enjoy their fastest annual growth in three years during the final quarter of 2016 but the sector's PMI suggested growth slowed in the first three months of this year.\"Greater optimism about global growth prospects appears to be providing a boost, while the fall in the value of the pound post-Brexit is helping new orders,\" James Smith at ING said of the British PMI.\"Whilst the near-term outlook for manufacturing looks encouraging, it's possible that Brexit uncertainty will start to weigh more heavily on sentiment over coming months.\"TRUMP TRADEThe official Chinese PMI on Friday rose to 51.8 in March from 51.6, thanks to a months-long construction boom which is helping to boost resources prices around the world.That was the strongest reading since April 2012, though a private survey focusing on smaller companies suggested a more cautious outlook, raising questions about whether the export recovery can be sustained.Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said the strength in China won't last - measures to cool its overheated property market and tighter central bank policy is likely to curb investment and industrial activity in coming quarters.But the biggest risk for China may be brewing halfway across the world. U.S. President Donald Trump is due to hold his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Florida later this week and those talks may be tense.On Friday, Trump sought to push his crusade against U.S. trade deficits and for more manufacturing jobs back to the top of his agenda, by ordering a study into the causes of the trade deficits and a clampdown on import duty evasion.The failure of the new U.S. administration to push through healthcare reforms last month has also added to global worries Trump will struggle to pass the tax cuts and spending plans he promised, which could boost demand in the world's largest economy.Delays to the re-flationary plans could see U.S. orders and global investment slow in coming months as businesses grow more cautious.China has strong domestic demand to fall back on, at least for now, but other export-reliant Asian economies are more vulnerable if Trump goes on a trade offensive.Japanese factory activity expanded at a solid clip in March, though the pace slowed from the previous month as growth in new export orders and output slowed.In South Korea, where exports account for half of the economy and domestic demand is similarly weak, readings have been decidedly mixed.On a more upbeat note, India's manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in five months as output and new orders accelerated.The findings suggested the world's fastest-growing major economy has largely recovered from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision in November to ban high-value currency notes, which caused huge disruptions to the largely cash-based economy. \"Asia's economic backdrop remains solid with most countries remaining above the key threshold level of expansion, though U.S. trade protectionism fears is the biggest uncertainty for now,\" said Aidan Yao, an economist at AXA Investment Managers.

They are hoping to overturn a 2015 New York federal appeals court ruling that the bank could not be sued under the statute because it is a corporation.The Alien Tort Statute, a law dating back to 1789, lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in U.S. courts for human rights violations abroad. The lead plaintiff in the case is Joseph Jesner, whose British citizen son was killed at age 19 in a 2002 suicide bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv.The plaintiffs filed several lawsuits under the law in Brooklyn federal court, claiming Arab Bank used its New York branch to transfer money and \"serve as a 'paymaster' for international terrorists.\" The transfers helped Hamas and other groups fund attacks and reward families of the perpetrators between 1995 and 2005, the suits alleged. The bank said in court papers that the U.S. government has called it a constructive partner in the fight against terrorism financing. The bank said only four transactions out of 500,000 involved \"designated terrorists\" by the U.S. government, and they were the result of machine or human error. The bank also cited a separate 2010 case, Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum, in which the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that corporations cannot be sued under the Alien Tort Statute. After reviewing that case, the Supreme Court in 2013 narrowed the law's reach, saying claims must sufficiently \"touch and concern\" the United States to overcome the presumption that the Alien Tort Statute does not cover foreign conduct. But the high court declined to explicitly decide whether the 2nd Circuit ruling on corporate liability was correct. Based on the Kiobel ruling, the 2nd Circuit threw out the litigation against Arab Bank. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, urging it to decide once and for all whether or not corporations are shielded over foreign conduct.

FRAUD ALLEGATIONS Lasso, who had proclaimed himself victorious based on a top pollster's exit poll, disputed the close results that would extend a decade-long leftist rule in oil-rich Ecuador. \"They've crossed a line,\" he told supporters in a hotel in his coastal hometown of Guayaquil on Sunday, vowing to challenge the results, a complex process that could take time. \"We're going to defend the will of the Ecuadorean people in the face of this fraud attempt,\" he said.Lasso tweeted photos showing what he said were original votes for him that were changed by electoral officials. The election authority denied fraud allegations.Lasso contrasted Sunday's quickly tallied vote with the first round in February, when the results took days to come out.Hundreds of his supporters swarmed in front of electoral council offices in the capital, Quito, and Guayaquil, waving yellow, blue and red Ecuadorean flags and chanting \"No to fraud!\" and \"We don't want to be Venezuela!\" There were reports of isolated clashes on Sunday night, but protests ebbed as the night went on. \"This is shameless fraud, we all know it,\" said taxi driver Roberto Vera, 50, on Monday. \"They're from the Venezuelan school, that's their governance model and it will do great harm to all Ecuadoreans.\"But ruling Country Alliance officials scoffed that Lasso was a sore loser and inciting violence. Going forward, Moreno's party has control of Congress, but he will need to cultivate support from many in the polarized country who view his narrow win with suspicion. 'LENIN PRESIDENT!'Moreno, who lost the use of his legs two decades ago when he was shot during a robbery, would become a rare head of state to use a wheelchair when he takes office on May 24. \"Lenin,\" as he is commonly referred to by his supporters, celebrated in mountainous Quito overnight with the flag-waving crowd chanting, \"Lenin President!\"\"We're going to keep building the path. We've done a lot but there's a lot more to do!\" he said, flanked by running mate and current vice president, Jorge Glas, as well as beaming outgoing President Rafael Correa. He broke into several songs, including one about Argentine revolutionary hero Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. Moreno, a former U.N. special envoy on disability and accessibility, has a more conciliatory style than the fiery Correa and has promised benefits for single mothers, the elderly, and disabled Ecuadoreans.He will be under pressure to create jobs and crack down on graft amid corruption scandals at state-run oil company PetroEcuador and Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht [ODBES.UL].Lasso has criticized Moreno as being ill-equipped to deal with economic issues and warned that his major social promises would hit already pressured coffers in a country dependent on exports of oil, bananas, and shrimp. \"Moreno's margin of victory was much smaller than those of his predecessor Rafael Correa, leaving him in a much weaker spot,\" said John Polga, a political scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy. \"He has the advantage of a legislative majority (for now), but his government will have to confront fiscal restraints, a stagnant economy, and the burden of a recovery from last April's earthquake.\" (Additional reporting by Yury Garcia, Daniel Tapia, and Henry Romero in Guayaquil and Jose Llangari and Mariana Bazo in Quito; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Jeffrey Benkoe)"},

Digital photography and social media could allow an invasion of the sanctity of the voting booth and \"eliminate the anonymity of the secret ballot,\" Gardner said. \"With recent advances in technology, one's right to vote freely without fear of retaliation is in jeopardy,\" Gardner added.Some states, including nearby Rhode Island, have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies, reasoning in part that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process.

Despite renting a house with a garden for far less than it would cost in Israel itself, it didn't make sense. Her new apartment in Israel may be small, but unlike where she used to live it has a supermarket and a clinic nearby, it's a quicker commute to work and she feels her children are safer.\"It's easier to get things done,\" said the 26-year-old kindergarten assistant, adding that the decision was not based on expedience alone. \"I started feeling uncomfortable living in a settlement. Personally, I don't think building more and more settlements is going to help bring peace.\"To the world, the narrative on settlements often reads one way: more of them being built, with more settlers moving in. But there are cracks in the picture, and signs Reback's perspective is not uncommon - settlers are getting fed up. Statistics show the population continues to rise, having now reached around 400,000 in the West Bank and 200,000 in East Jerusalem.But behind the figures lies a different story. Although the population may have risen by nearly two-thirds in the past decade, the rate of increase has slowed sharply, according to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics.A decade ago, for every 1,000 settlers already living in occupied territory, 20 more arrived each year. Now the expansion rate is just six per 1,000.\"The settlement enterprise is waning and what is left is being artificially kept alive by the government pouring money in,\" said Shaul Arieli, an analyst at the Economic Cooperation Foundation, a think-tank that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Since capturing the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, successive Israeli governments have helped establish more than 120 settlements, spending billions of dollars to build tens of thousand of homes and the infrastructure to support them: roads, electricity, gas, water and communications.There are scores more informal settler outposts, some of which have also received government funding.While Israel's right-wing government is in talks with the Trump administration about limiting expansion, it has also promised to build thousands more units this year to accommodate what it calls \"natural growth\" - families having more children.    Yet while population growth in the settlements is higher than the national average, its rate is also falling: In 1995, it stood at 10 percent. By 2015, it had dropped to 4 percent.Leaders of the settler movement acknowledge the decline but say it does not reflect falling popularity. While the downturn is a concern, they say it stems from government curbs on construction: people aren't moving to the settlements because there aren't enough homes to house them. \"The pioneering settlement spirit, the desire to return to those places where the people of Israel have always been, is just getting stronger,\" said Yigal Dilmoni, deputy head of the Yesha Council, the settlers' main representative body.That is what concerns the international community, which views settlements on occupied land as a breach of international law and an obstacle to peace between Israelis and Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. Israel disputes the view that the settlements are illegal, and argues that it has biblical and historical ties to the land. Some right-wing members of the Israeli government want to annex up to 60 percent of the West Bank and massively ramp up the settlement enterprise.AFFORDABILITYPalestinians see any expansion of settlements as part of an Israeli project to deny them a state.\"They are building settlements at a rate of construction that is politically motivated,\" Xavier Abu Eid, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority's Negotiations Affairs Department. \"Settlements and the incentives given to settlers are part of the Israeli government's agenda. The two-state solution is clearly not.\"Settlement population growth is now largely driven by a handful of settlements built for the ultra-Orthodox community, whose families on average have six children.Over the past two decades, the two main ultra-orthodox settlements, Beitar Illit and Modiin Illit, have grown from comprising about 10 percent of the West Bank settler population to making up nearly a third of it.Unlike many of the hardline, ideological settlements deep in the West Bank, Beitar Illit and Modiin Illit are adjacent to Israel and would probably be incorporated in any peace deal with the Palestinians. Their cramped apartment blocs stand in stark contrast to the red-roofed, spacious houses with gardens that identify most settlements built on West Bank hilltops.Ultra-Orthodox residents say they moved here because it's cheap. The conflict with the Palestinians and settling the land are not on their minds. Any place that enables their often poor and close-knit community to live together is fine. \"Politically I'm not bothered. All those global considerations are not something the average ultra-Orthodox family can afford,\" said 37-year-old Motti Hizkiyahu, standing outside a discount store in Modiin Illit. GETTING OUTWhile the rate of people moving to settlements and the growth within them has tapered, there are also signs of a generational shift in some of the most established, ideological settlements that spearheaded the movement in the 1970s.  Itzik Fleger, a real-estate agent in Beit-El settlement, said the founding generation is beginning to get older, their children have grown up and some have moved away. It took Ruchi Avital two years of deliberations until she left the settlement of Ofra, her home of 30 years, to be closer to her children, all of whom moved out of the West Bank. She is a still an ardent supporter of the settlement enterprise, but a desire to be closer to her children overrode ideology.Pictures of her former two-storey house and garden are affixed to her refrigerator in her new Jerusalem apartment, which she said is double the price and half the size.While Ofra has seen more people leave than arrive in recent years, Avital, 64, believes it still has a future. \"It's reached a critical mass, it's mature enough now that it can handle people coming and leaving,\" she said, adding that a family with children had moved into her old home.Arieli, of the Economic Cooperation Foundation, says the reality is different.

In terms of other e-bikes this is much lighter weight, and much safer because it's like sitting inside a large crash helmet,\" Grant Sinclair told Reuters.  Sinclair, 44, showed off the zippy 55 kilogram (121 pounds) one-seater vehicle in a ride over Old Town Bridge from England to Wales, riding ahead of a post van and then through a path in a local park.The Iris has normal bicycle pedals and eight-speed race bike gearing, combined with a 250-watt electric motor with rechargeable battery pack that kicks in automatically once pedaling is detected. Recharging takes one hour.Sinclair said his vehicle, which can reach speeds of upto 30 miles per hour (48 kph) and be ridden for up to 50 miles (80 km) with the motor, had grabbed the attention of three established manufacturers who were keen to mass produce it.He is the third Sinclair to attempt to convince the world about eTrikes, with Clive's son Crispin failing two years ago with a design called Babel, which was unable to raise the required funds through crowdfunding.The original C5 enjoyed millions of investment but managed minimal sales before it was discontinued, but Grant Sinclair is optimistic the world is now ready for e-Trikes. \"I think the C5 would have a much easier time these days because you have cycle paths everywhere,\" Sinclair said.The Iris Trike will cost 3,999 pounds ($5,000) with first deliveries anticipated in late 2017.

The Supreme Court declined to hear the state's appeal of a ruling by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September that the law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees free speech. The state cannot curtail speech based on a hypothetical danger, the appeals court stated.Ballot selfies have become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates through postings on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat. Three New Hampshire residents who were under investigation for violating the law, including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the 2014 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, sued the state that year claiming the measure violated the First Amendment.The 1st Circuit agreed last year, noting that New Hampshire had no complaints of vote-buying or evidence that people were being coerced to vote a certain way.New Hampshire's secretary of state, William Gardner, appealed to the Supreme Court, noting that 18 states had laws that in some form prevented voters from displaying their ballots. Digital photography and social media could allow an invasion of the sanctity of the voting booth and \"eliminate the anonymity of the secret ballot,\" Gardner said. \"With recent advances in technology, one's right to vote freely without fear of retaliation is in jeopardy,\" Gardner added.Some states, including nearby Rhode Island, have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies, reasoning in part that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process.

PETERSBURG, Russia At least nine people were killed and 20 were injured when an explosion tore through a train carriage in the St. Petersburg metro system on Monday, the Russian National Anti-Terrorist Committee said.Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying the blast, which occurred when the train was between two stations, was caused by a bomb filled with shrapnel.President Vladimir Putin, who was in the city for a meeting with Belarus's leader, said he was considering all possible causes for the blast, including terrorism and was consulting with security services.Ambulances and fire engines descended on the concrete-and-glass Sennaya Ploshchad metro station. A helicopter hovered overhead as crowds gathered to observe rescue operations.\"I appeal to you citizens of St. Petersburg and guests of our city to be alert, attentive and cautious and to behave in a responsible matter in light of events,\" St Petersburg Governor Georgy Poltavchenko said in an address.An attack on St Petersburg, Russia's old imperial capital, would have some symbolic force for any militant group, especially Islamic State or Chechen secessionist rebels. Attacks in the past have largely concentrated on Moscow, including an attack on an airport, a theater and in 2010 a metro train.Video showed injured people lying bleeding on a platform, some being treated by emergency services and fellow passengers. Others ran away from the platform amid clouds of smoke, some screaming or holding their hands to their faces.A huge hole was blown open in the side of a carriage with  metal wreckage strewn across the platform. Passengers were seen hammering at the windows of one closed carriage. Russian TV said many had suffered lacerations from glass shards and metal.Russia has been the target of attacks by separatist Islamist Chechen militants in past years. Islamic State, which has drawn recruits from the ranks of Chechen rebels, has also threatened attacks across Russia in retaliation for Russian military intervention in Syria.The Russian air force and special forces have been supporting President Bashar al-Assad in fighting rebel groups and Islamic State fighters now being driven out of their Syrian strongholds.ALL STATIONS CLOSEDSt. Petersburg emergency services at first said that there had been two explosions. But a source in the emergency services later said that there had been only one but that the explosion had occurred in a tunnel between stations.The blast occurred at 2.40 p.m., well shy of the evening rush hour.Authorities closed all St. Petersburg metro stations. The Moscow metro said it was taking unspecified additional security measures in case of an attack there. Russia has been on particular alert against Chechen rebels returning from Syria and wary of any attempts to resume attacks that dogged the country several years ago.At least 38 people were killed in 2010 when two female suicide bombers detonated bombs on packed Moscow metro trains.Over 330 people, half of them children, were killed in 2004 when police stormed a school in southern Russia after a hostage taking by Islamist militants. In 2002, 120 hostages were killed when police stormed a Moscow theater to end another hostage-taking.Putin, as prime minister, launched a 1999 campaign to crush a separatist government in the Muslim southern region of Chechnya, and as president continued a hard line in suppressing rebellion.

And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won\u2019t. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don\u2019t it won\u2019t be good for anyone,\" Trump was quoted as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the newspaper.Asked what incentive the United States had to offer China, Trump replied: \"Trade is the incentive. It is all about trade.\"Asked if he would consider a \"grand bargain\" in which China pressured Pyongyang in return for a guarantee the United States would later remove troops from the Korean peninsula, the newspaper quoted Trump as saying: \"Well if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you.\"It is not clear whether Trump's comments will move China, which has taken steps to increase economic pressure on Pyongyang but has long been unwilling to do anything that may destabilize the North and send millions of refugees across their border.It is also unclear what the United States might do on its own to deflect North Korea from the expansion of its nuclear capabilities and from the development of missiles with ever-longer ranges and the capacity to deliver atomic warheads.NORTH KOREA REVIEW COMPLETEDTrump's national security aides have completed a review of U.S. options to try to curb North Korea's nuclear and missile programs that includes economic and military measures but leans more toward sanctions and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its reclusive neighbor, a U.S. official said.Although the option of pre-emptive military strikes on North Korea is not off the table, the review prioritizes less-risky steps and \"de-emphasizes direct military action,\" the official added, saying it was not immediately known if the National Security Council recommendations had made their way to Trump.The White House declined comment on the recommendations.Trump and Xi are also expected to discuss Chinese ambitions in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, when they meet on Thursday and Friday. China claims most of the resource-rich South China Sea, while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the strategic waterway.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke on Sunday with China's top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, about Xi's visit \"and other issues of bilateral and regional importance,\" a State Department official said on condition of anonymity.China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday about the call that Yang had described the meeting between Xi and Trump as being of \"great significance\" for peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.Tillerson told Yang that the United States would do its utmost to ensure that the meeting had \"positive results,\" the ministry said.Trump's deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland, said there was a \"real possibility\" North Korea could be capable of hitting the United States with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of Trump's four-year term, the Financial Times reported.McFarland's estimate appeared more pessimistic than those of many experts.\"The typical estimates are that it will take five years or so,\" said Siegfried Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States and a leading expert on North Korea's nuclear program.Such estimates are notoriously hard to make both because of the scarcity of intelligence about North Korea and uncertainty about how high a success rate Pyongyang might want for such missiles.John Schilling, a contributor to the \"38 North\" North Korea monitoring project, said Pyongyang might have missiles capable of limited strikes on the U.S. mainland by the end of Trump's term, but \"it will most likely be a bit later than that.\"\"I doubt that any missile they could put into service by the end of 2020 will be very reliable, but perhaps it doesn't have to be - one or two successes out of six launches against the U.S. would be a political game-changer to say the least,\" Schilling said.

Conservative presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso had vowed to roll back that welcome mat and remove Assange within 30 days of winning office, making global headlines and spooking Assange's supporters.As it became clear Lasso was on the verge of defeat, Assange sent him a tongue-in-cheek message on Sunday night. \"I cordially invite Lasso to leave Ecuador within 30 days (with or without his tax haven millions),\" wrote Assange on Twitter, amid accusations that Lasso had dodged taxes by stashing cash abroad. Government candidate Lenin Moreno, meanwhile, has promised to keep hosting Assange in the Andean country's embassy - although he warned he may take a tougher stance. Moreno said in an interview with leftist broadcaster TeleSUR in February that he would ask Assange \"not to intervene in the politics of countries that are friends of Ecuador.\"Assange, who enraged Washington by publishing a flood of secret U.S. diplomatic cables, entered the London embassy fearing that Sweden could end up sending him on to the United States where he could face a long prison term for leaking U.S. secrets. He has repeatedly denied the rape allegations. Though he will be able to stay on in the embassy, the tight presidential election in Ecuador highlighted just how vulnerable he is should a new government be ushered in. Lasso said Ecuador, a largely poor country struggling amid an economic downturn, was wrong to host Assange.     \"Ecuador had no business spending a single cent protecting someone who definitely leaked confidential information,\" Lasso told Reuters in an interview in February in his sweltering coastal hometown of Guayaquil. Despite its global importance, Assange's case barely featured in the Ecuadorean campaign, which centered on jobs and social benefits.

A spokesman said UKMTO could not confirm the location of the vessel, which he identified as Al Kausar, or what exactly had taken place. Investigations were continuing. \"We understand Somali pirates hijacked a commercial Indian ship (and it is heading) toward Somalia shores,\" Abdirizak Mohamed Dirir, a former director of the anti-piracy agency in Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region, told Reuters.Somali pirates hijacked an oil tanker last month, the first such seizure of a vessel since 2012, but released it after a clash with the Puntland marine force.Somalis have been angered by a recent influx of foreign fishermen into their waters, some of whom have been given licenses to operate there by the Somali government.Graeme Gibbon-Brooks of UK-based Dryad Maritime Security said industry sources had told him the Indian vessel had been en route to Bosasso from Dubai when it was hijacked on Saturday. The pirates on board were taking the ship and its 11 crew members to Eyl in Puntland, he said.  Muse Osman Yusuf, Eyl's district commissioner, said authorities were ready to confront the pirates.\"We shall not allow it. Puntland maritime police forces have a base here and we shall fight the pirates in case they come,\" he told Reuters.An Indian government official said the 11 crew were all Indian and that officials were in touch with the Somali government.\"This confirms that the pirates still have the ability to go to sea and take vessels, and the international shipping industry needs to take additional precautions,\" John Steed of the aid group Oceans Beyond Piracy told Reuters.In 2011, pirates launched 237 attacks off the coast of Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau, and took hundreds of hostages.Shipping companies responded with security measures such as armed guards, blocking easy entry points to vessels with barbed wire and installing secure panic rooms. In a separate incident, UKMTO said on its website that early on Monday six skiffs had approached a vessel and that ladders and hooks were sighted.Armed guards on board the vessel took up positions and the skiffs departed, leaving the vessel unharmed, UKTMO said.

The company is backed by private equity fund Cresta Energy LP, whose management includes former executives from Regency Energy Partners LP, a large energy infrastructure company that was bought by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP.N) in 2015.  NAmerico Managing Partner Jeff Welch told Reuters in an interview this week that discussions with prospective shippers were at an advanced stage, and the pipeline would begin operations in 2019 if enough of them committed to supplying gas. He declined to identify the shippers but said the company was confident the project would proceed.NAmerico's 468-mile (753-km) pipeline, named the Pecos Trail Pipeline, would transport some 1.85 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to the major Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical hub in Corpus Christi.Last month, Kinder Morgan, which operates the largest natural gas pipeline network in North America, outlined a plan to build a 430-mile (692-kilometer) pipe traveling a similar route. It would be able to move 1.7 bcf per day of gas.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD.N), another large pipeline operator, has said it may build a gas line to Corpus Christi, Texas, from the Permian.\"We've got this gigantic gas supply in West Texas, and big exports southbound and eastbound,\" Rick Smead, managing director of advisory services for consultancy RBN Energy, said in a telephone interview.Kinder Morgan has also said its pipeline would begin operations in 2019 if enough shippers commit.Analysts said the potential for new supplies could allow multiple projects to proceed.The projects are being planned as big producers including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Apache Corp (APA.N), and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) are expected to pour billions of dollars into drilling in the Permian, a vast shale play in West Texas known for its low production costs and massive reserves. Demand for natural gas in south Texas and the Corpus Christi area is expected to soar in the coming years. Cheniere Energy has said it has customers for 8.42 million metric tons a year of LNG from its site, which is expected to begin operations around 2018.Exxon and Saudi Basic Industries Corp 2010.SE, an arm of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned energy company, also have proposed building a multibillion-dollar chemical and plastics plant outside of Corpus Christi. That plant would use natural gas as a raw material.Natural gas production in West Texas is expected to more than quadruple by the middle of the next decade, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N), a large Permian producer, said last month.Gas production in the Permian is projected to reach 7.9 Bcf/d in April, up from 5.4 bcf/d the same month in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The number of drilling rigs operating in the region has more than doubled in the last year to 319 as of March 31, according to energy services provider Baker Hughes (BHI.N). While companies are primarily drilling in the Permian for crude, natural gas comes up along with it. The EIA estimates each new rig in March added in the Permian increases the field's gas production by 1.1 million cubic feet a day.

Cosby, whose career and wholesome image were shattered by the accusations, has said every sexual encounter was consensual.Like numerous other women, Constand has accused Cosby of giving her pills in order to incapacitate her.In court documents filed last week, prosecutors said Cosby's description of Spanish fly demonstrated his long-held interest in \"date-rape drugs.\"\"He explained that all it took was a single drop into a woman's drink, and she was then yours,\" prosecutors wrote in recounting Cosby's 1991 appearance on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"But Cosby's lawyers responded that the comments were jokes intended to entertain his audience and had nothing to do with the present case.\"These jokes are not about Mr. Cosby, not about assault, and not about rendering anyone unconscious,\" his lawyers wrote.In addition, defense lawyers plan to ask Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill to keep jurors from hearing about the settlement he signed with Constand in her civil case, arguing that it could be seen as evidence of criminal guilt.A federal judge in 2015 released excerpts from a deposition Cosby gave in Constand's civil case in which Cosby acknowledged having obtained Quaaludes, the brand name for a sedative widely abused as a recreational drug in the 1970s, with the intent of giving the pills to young women in order to have sex with them.The two sides in the criminal case are also expected to argue over how to proceed with jury selection, given the amount of publicity that the case has generated.

Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd (600600.SS), China's number two brewer, posted its steepest drop in net profit in 20 years last week, blaming tough competition and weak demand. Noodle maker Tingyi (0322.HK) saw profits drop by a third.China's top cinema operator Wanda Cinema Line (002739.SZ) saw 2016 profits rise 15.2 percent - down from growth of nearly 50 percent the year before, as broader box office sales stalled. IMAX China's (1970.HK) profit tumbled, too.  \"There's still a tonne of room for growth, but these markets are much more competitive now and even bigger brands are starting to struggle,\" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.\"Consumers are becoming more cagey about how they're spending their money, (from) food to clothing and movies.\"Increased caution - and sophistication - will push companies to innovate, and to spend more to fend off competitors, if they are to survive, analysts said.After growing at the slowest pace in 26 years in 2016, official data have indicated a strong start to the economy this year, supported by bank lending, a government infrastructure spree and a much-needed resurgence in private investment.But China's consumption trends have been less clear.Retail sales in December rose at their fastest pace in a year, thanks to cars and cosmetics, but they disappointed in the first two months of this year.Consumption contributed the bulk of China's growth last year at nearly 65 percent, but income growth didn't pick up, and a measure of China's income inequality rose slightly last year.A private business survey last month showed growth in the services sector slowed to a four-month low as increasing competition made it harder for companies to pass higher input costs on to consumers.To be sure, the picture from recent earnings reports is not comprehensive nor uniform.But the drop in profits of some of China's best-known names flags the uneven nature of the country's gradual shift to a consumer-driven economy, and the challenge for both brands and Beijing, which needs to stoke domestic consumption and private investment to fuel growth.Of course there were bright spots.In areas like sports apparel, firms such as Li Ning Co Ltd (2331.HK) and ANTA Sports (2020.HK) predicted a boost as China looks to build its sports industry and consumers become increasingly health conscious. Li Ning's profits rose sharply.But global uncertainties - from the impact of trade policies under new U.S. President Donald Trump to political uncertainty in Europe - are expected to cloud the year.\"In 2017, great uncertainties in the economic outlook remain in view of the changes in political and economic policies in some key regions,\" China Resources Beer (0291.HK) said.The brewer reported sluggish sales growth, but also its first annual profit in three years this month.Retailers also reported a mixed outlook, although a slowdown in e-commerce was creating opportunities elsewhere.White goods maker Qingdao Haier (600690.SS), which posted annual net profit growth of 3.1 percent, said China was in a new normal of consumer growth - but expects sales to eventually accelerate with rising salaries and demand for high-tech homes.Others bore the cost of change: home appliance retailer GOME (0493.HK) posted a 73 percent drop in full-year profit as it spent on a strategic shake-up.\"Looking into 2017, it is expected that (the Chinese) and global economy will continue to face downward pressure, leading to sluggish market demand,\" said Chairman Li Dongsheng of television maker TCL Multimedia (1070.HK).

Third place would mean Fillon's elimination from the May 7 runoff.State-run Sputnik carried different findings in a report on March 29 under the headline: \"2017 presidential elections: the return of Fillon at the head of the polls\".(For election graphic click here : tmsnrt.rs/2lPduBG)It quoted Moscow-based Brand Analytics, an online audience research firm, as saying that its study based on an analysis of French social media put Fillon out in front.In a statement, France's polling commission said the study could not be described as representative of public opinion and Sputnik had improperly called it a \"poll\", as defined by law in France\"It is imperative that publication of this type of survey  be treated with caution so that public opinion is aware of its non-representative nature,\" it said.Brand Analytics' track record either for political polling or for commercial internet audience measurement outside of Russia and former Soviet territory is unknown.Sputnik published an earlier online survey by the firm from mid-February which also showed Fillon with a strong lead over Macron and Le Pen at a time when other polls showed Macron\u2019s candidacy beginning to surge with Fillon in third place.Neither Sputnik in Moscow, nor the company, responded immediately to emailed requests for comment on Sunday. U.S. INTELLIGENCE WARNS    Richard Burr, head of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating the Russian hacking during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, said last week that the Kremlin was trying to interfere in the French vote.  The Kremlin denied in February that it was behind media and internet attacks on Macron's campaign.Russia has a strong interest in the outcome of the French election since Macron has suggested imposing further sanctions on Moscow if it does not implement its side of a deal to resolve the crisis in Ukraine.Fillon, once the frontrunner for the Elysee before he was hit by a scandal surrounding payments of public funds to his wife and children, dismissed as \"fantasy\" concerns of Russian interference in the election. Speaking last Friday, Fillon said he would seek a better balance in relations with a country that was nevertheless \"dangerous\".   Richard Ferrand, the head of Macron's En Marche! (Onwards!) party, said in February that Sputnik and another Russian state-run outlet Russia Today were spreading 'fake news' with the aim of swinging public opinion against Macron.In February, Sputnik announced it would publish weekly French election polls using representative sampling from three mainstream polling firms - IFOP, Ipsos and OpinionWay - alongside an analysis of social media posts in France from Brand Analytics for which it did not disclose its survey methodology.  Separately, Sputnik carried a news report last Friday about Macron supporters being awarded state decorations when he had been a high-level functionary at the Elysee and economy minister in the Socialist government, suggesting this could amount to influence peddling.It offered no proof that Macron had organized the decorations, which were sometimes awarded by other ministers. In several instances, it cited awards made by the economy ministry, without mentioning that Arnaud Montebourg, Macron's predecessor, was minister at the time.The Sputnik report contrasted Macron's alleged action with a judicial inquiry into an award made when Fillon was prime minister to a billionaire friend who owned a cultural magazine where Fillon's wife drew a salary.

Four people have died in floods in Queensland and New South Wales states, with another three missing.  Coal hauler Aurizon Holdings said on Monday it would take up to five weeks to repair parts of its network of rail lines that connects mines to ports in Queensland, with alternative routes being considered for coal transported on the worst-affected Goonyella line.Queensland accounts for more than 50 percent of global seaborne coking coal supplies, with Goonyella alone transporting more than half of the state's coal - mostly coking coal, used for steel making.\"The entire industry is facing a force majeure issue. I don't see any way around it if it is going to impact that amount of shipments,\" said a senior industry source.Yancoal Australia Ltd already declared force majeure on its Middlemount mine, with bigger operators waiting to see if they will be able to fulfill contracts with customers in Japan, China, South Korea and India.The floods are the worst to hit the region since Cyclone Yasi in 2011 which inundated many coal mines and led to a surge in prices as miners struggled to resume output.By Monday several coal terminals, including Abbot Point and Dalrymple Bay, had reopened but had not yet commenced shipping coal, officials said.AME Group chief economist Mark Pervan said the export of 12 to 15 million tonnes of coal shipments could be affected.\"We're talking 3 to 4 percent of global coking supply with a question mark over it,\" Pervan said.The disruptions could push up the price of hard coking coal, currently around $159 a tonne, and feed into second-quarter contract prices between miners and steelmakers, depending on stockpiles held at ports and by steelmakers.\"Once those are depleted expect the spot market to be well bid,\" said Commonwealth Bank commodities strategist Vivek Dhar. U.S.-based coal producer Peabody Energy Corp said its Queensland mines had restarted but it was too early to assess the impact of the rail outages. A Glencore spokesman said coal export volumes would be \"significantly impacted\" until repairs to the rail system were completed.Representatives from Anglo American PLC Rio Tinto and BHP, which runs its mines in partnership with Japan's Mitsubishi Corp, could not immediately comment on the impact of the rail stoppages.HUMAN TOLLWhile the low pressure system is moving out to the Tasman Sea, persistent rain and run-off mean floodwaters continue to rise in some areas.\"It's just debris everywhere, with piles of rubbish and desks and chairs and computers and all sort of stuff just pulled out of shops and put on the kerb,\" said emergency services worker Narelle Johnson, speaking to Reuters from the flooded town of Lismore.\"I think in a lot of ways today is when it's really sort of starting to hit, but the town itself is really pulling together.\"The Insurance Council of Australia said nearly 20,000 claims had already been filed, with an early insured loss figure of A$224 million ($171 million), a number sure to rise.In the cyclone-hit tropics, Australia's Defence Force was helping to deliver medical personnel and supplies, while tens of thousands of people remain without electricity.At Rockhampton in Queensland, river levels are still rising and are due to peak on Wednesday, with major flooding predicted.

But with nationalist, anti-EU parties on the rise across Europe, they cannot afford to give London generous terms that might encourage other member states to break away.BREXIT DEAL?May's notice of the UK's intention to leave the bloc under Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty was hand-delivered to Tusk in Brussels by Tim Barrow, Britain's permanent representative to the EU, on the top floor of the new Europa Building in Brussels.That moment formally set the clock ticking on Britain's two-year exit process. Sterling, which has lost 25 cents against the dollar since the June 23 referendum, jumped to $1.25.May signed the six-page Brexit letter on Tuesday night, pictured alone at the cabinet table beneath a clock, a British flag and an oil painting of Britain's first prime minister, Robert Walpole.Her letter sought to set a positive tone for the talks though it admitted that the task of extracting the UK from the EU was momentous and that reaching comprehensive agreements within two years would be a challenge.May wants to negotiate Britain's divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU within the two-year period, though EU officials say that will be hard.\"We believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU,\" May told Tusk in her letter, adding that London wanted an ambitious free trade agreement with the EU.\"If, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms,\" she said.May's most powerful European interlocutor, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, promised to take a \"fair and constructive\" approach to Brexit talks, but said Britain could negotiate its new relationship only after it untangles existing EU commitments.\"We must deal with many rights and obligations that have been linked to membership. Only then, later, can we talk about our future relationship.\"TRADE AND SECURITYMay has promised to seek the greatest possible access to European markets but said Britain was not seeking membership of the \"single market\" of 500 million people as she understood there could be no \"cherry picking\" of a free trade area based on unfettered movement of goods, services, capital and people.Britain will aim to establish its own free trade deals with countries beyond Europe, and impose limits on immigration from the continent, May has said.In an attempt to start Brexit talks on a conciliatory note, May said she wanted a special partnership with the EU, though she laced that ambition with an a clear linkage of the economic and security relationship.EU leaders will welcome assurances of a constructive approach, as well as an explicit recognition that Britain cannot retain the best bits of membership after leaving.They may be less warm to an implication that Britain could live with a breakdown of talks on trade coupled with what might be seen as a threat to disrupt the security and counterterrorism cooperation for which Britain.\"We should work together to minimize disruption and give as much certainty as possible,\" May said. \"Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake.\"Tusk said the EU would seek to minimize the cost of Brexit to EU citizens and businesses and that Brussels wanted an orderly withdrawal for Britain. \"We already miss you,\" said Tusk who will send the 27 other states draft negotiating guidelines within 48 hours. \"Thank you and goodbye.\"In a draft resolution to be voted on next week, lawmakers in the European Parliament offered a faint glimmer of hope to the 48 percent of British voters who opposed Brexit, saying it was not too late for Britain to reverse the process.U.S. President Donald Trump has been an enthusiastic proponent of Brexit, unlike his predecessor Barack Obama. White House spokesman Sean Spicer struck a neutral tone on Wednesday, saying Washington respected the will of British voters and backed a strong Britain and strong EU.\"Whatever future the UK-EU relationship looks like, we want the UK to remain a strong leader in Europe, for both the UK, the EU and Europe to remain strong leaders globally,\" Spicer said.\"DAMN NARROW\" TIME FRAMEThe course of the Brexit talks - and even their scope - are uncertain.\"The time frame is damn narrow,\" said Martin Schaefer, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry.In recent months, German officials have made clear that they do not believe there is time to negotiate a bespoke transitional agreement for Britain that would come into force immediately after Brexit.A huge number of questions remain, including whether exporters will keep tariff-free access to the single market and whether British-based banks will still be able to serve continental clients, not to mention immigration and the future rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons living in Europe.Adding more uncertainty, France and Germany both face elections this year.\"It\u2019s bad news for everybody. It\u2019s a wedge pushed into the European project,\" said French centrist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who has made clear he would ensure Britain gains no undue advantages outside the Union.At home, a divided Britain faces strains that could lead to its break-up. In the Brexit referendum, England and Wales voted to leave the EU but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.Scottish nationalists have demanded an independence referendum that May has refused. In Northern Ireland, rival parties are embroiled in a major political crisis and Sinn Fein nationalists are demanding a vote on leaving the UK and uniting with the Republic of Ireland.May said she knew that triggering Brexit would be a day of celebration for some and disappointment for others.\"Now that the decision to leave has been made and the process is under way, it is time to come together,\" she said.

OUTSIDERSIn France, Barnier rose young and fast in Gaullist politics after an education at a Paris business school. But while he won respect running the 1992 Winter Olympics, and as a minister for the environment and later agriculture as well as a European Commissioner, a Parisian elite coached in the prestigious ENA civil service college never took him for one of its own. It scoffed at a perceived lack of wit and brilliance during his brief tenure speaking for France as foreign minister.Davis also went to business school, in London, after grammar school and Warwick University -- like Barnier's, a CV short on the establishment glamor that Eton and Oxbridge conferred on many of his rivals, including David Cameron, who in 2005 would beat Davis to the Conservative Party leadership. Davis, who won a reputation as a rough-tongued \"bruiser\" when shadow home affairs minister, had the last laugh, however: Cameron gambled by calling last year's Brexit referendum to try and silence Davis and other raucous eurosceptics -- and lost.While Barnier was moving almost seamlessly from education to politics, Davis had a 15-year career in business in the 1970s and 80s, at the sugar refiner Tate and Lyle, a company that took a stand last year for Brexit and, since Davis's time there, has long complained about EU tariffs hurting cane sugar imports.Barnier is \"more European than French\", according to one senior EU official who has worked with him. Davis makes no secret of his deep dislike of the supranational institutions. As they climb together the mountain of challenges that Brexit represents, millions of Europeans will be hoping that their shared interests can prevent them falling off a cliff-edge through a breakdown in talks.

The first involves relatively small numbers of jobs to make sure the requisite licenses, technology and infrastructure are in place, while the next requires longer-term thinking on what their European business will look like in the future. This is when bigger moves might take place.   The British Bankers' Association and the City of London Corporation, which runs the financial district, said in statements it is crucial that after the conclusion of the talks banks retain as much access to the single market as possible.They both also said that Britain should announce a staggered departure from the EU that would allow British-based banks to prevent market disruption.Regulatory and banking experts working for the City of London and lobby group TheCityUK are drawing up proposals for a 'mutual recognition' system.Under this, the EU and Britain would broadly accept firms in each other's financial markets because their home regulatory systems apply similar standards. The aim is for London-based banks to keep serving continental clients, although skeptics say mutual recognition is largely untested globally and would struggle to win approval within the EU.

It was later allowed to dock, where an inspection team accompanied by an armed escort boarded the ship.        A December 2016 U.N. Security Council resolution placed a cap on exports of North Korean coal, and urged member states to apply extra scrutiny on North Korean ships. Production of coal in North Korea is state-controlled and its exports are a key source of hard currency for the isolated country's banned nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Relations between North Korea and Malaysia, which have been friendly for decades, have soured following the February assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's half-brother at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.The North Korean ship had been initially prevented from entering Penang Port due to a possible breach of U.N. sanctions, MMEA deputy director-general of operations Zulkifli Abu Bakar, told Reuters without offering further details.It was unclear what the inspectors were checking on.The United Nations in its annual reports on how members have complied with sanctions have cited a number of instances over the past decade in which North Korean missile parts and coal connected to sanctioned entities were trans-shipped through Malaysia.Malaysia is one of the few countries in the world which buys North Korean coal, with China by far the biggest importer. LUCKY STARThe KUM YA was recently re-flagged as a North Korean ship, changing its name from Lucky Star 7 in November last year, according to the Equasis shipping database. It was registered on Feb. 13 to North Korean shipping company Sonchonggang Water Transport, according to copies of the ship's registration documents, which were issued by North Korea's Maritime Administration, and seen by Reuters. The ship was carrying 20 crew members, and was scheduled to sail onto Singapore, the port worker said.The ship listed its port of origin as Busan, South Korea. However, shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows the cargo was loaded at the Huaneng Shandong Power Station Weihai, a coal-fired power plant. It then sailed to Penang through the South China Sea and the Malacca Strait, the data shows. (tmsnrt.rs/2ofxNXe)China halted all coal imports from North Korea starting on Feb. 26, amid growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula following one of a series of Pyongyang's missile tests.Malaysia's foreign ministry told officials at Penang Port not to let the ship dock before an inspection team had it \"declared safe,\" the port worker said.The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) confirmed the ship had been stopped following instructions from Malaysia's foreign ministry, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\"Many North Korean ships call on our ports and we never had problems. Just over the recent months, there have been problems,\" the port worker told Reuters. \"We have never received directives to stop North Korean ships before.\"NOT CONFISCATEDThe KUM YA was first stopped at sea before being allowed to dock in port where it was immediately cordoned off, the port worker said.\"Minerals and Geoscience Department officials were then called to inspect the cargo on board. The department officers were told to confirm it was indeed coal on board,\" the port worker said.The coal was being unloaded on Wednesday afternoon and has not been confiscated, the port worker said.Since 2011, Malaysia has imported over 2 million metric tonnes of coal a year, according to government statistics, which are not broken down by country of origin.The KUM YA shipment was handled by Malaysian freight forwarding company Alim Maritime Sdn Bhd, the port worker said. An Alim Maritime official reached by telephone declined to   comment.The KUM YA can hold up to 6,843 metric tonnes of cargo, according to Equasis, meaning it was 92 percent full when it arrived in Penang.

But  tens of thousands more are still trapped inside homes, caught in the fighting, shelling and air strikes as Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition advance in the west.Helicopters circling west Mosul strafed IS positions beyond the city train station, the site of heavy back-and-forth fighting in recent days, and thick black smoke rose into the sky, Reuters reporters on the ground said.Heavy sustained gunfire could be heard from the Old City area, where militants are hiding among residents and using the  alleyways, traditional family homes and snaking narrow roads to their advantage, fleeing residents say.\"Federal police forces have imposed full control over the Qadheeb al-Ban area and the al-Malab sports stadium in the western wing of Old Mosul and are besieging militants around the al-Nuri mosque,\" federal police chief Lieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat said in a statement.Rapid Response elite interior ministry troops were advancing on the edge of the Old City, clambering over garden walls. Islamic State responded with rocket fire, streaking the sky with white smoke plumes.\"There are teams going into the Old City since yesterday,\" said Rapid Response official Abd al-Amir.Iraqi troops shot down at least one suspected IS drone. The militants have been using small commercial models to spy and drop munitions on Iraqi military positions.A suicide truck bomber detonated his explosives in southern Baghdad, killing at least 17 people and wounding around 60 more, police sources said, in the latest attack on the capital since Islamic State began to lose ground in the offensive.CIVILIANS AT RISKWith the battle entering the densely populated areas of western Mosul, civilian casualties are becoming more of a risk. The United Nations says several hundred civilians have been killed in the last month, and residents say IS militants are using them as human shields.Pope Francis said at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday that it was \"urgent and imperative\" to protect civilians in Iraq, and he expressed concern about those trapped in western Mosul.The senior U.S. commander in Iraq acknowledged on Tuesday that the U.S.-led coalition probably had a role in an explosion in Mosul believed to have killed scores of civilians, but said Islamic State could also be to blame.As investigators probe the March 17 blast, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend said increases in casualties were to be expected as the war entered its deadliest phase.Local officials and eyewitnesses say as many as 240 people may have been killed in the Al-Jadida district when a huge blast caused a building to collapse, burying families inside. Rescue workers are still pulling bodies out of the site.One local health official said on Wednesday 250 bodies had been recovered from the site, though that is higher than Iraqi military estimates. But rescue efforts have been hampered by a lack of equipment and poor security.HUGE BLASTWhat exactly happened on March 17 is still unclear.Iraqi military command has said one line of investigation is whether Islamic State rigged explosives that ultimately caused the blast that destroyed buildings. Iraqi military said there was no indication the building was hit directly by the strike.Eyewitnesses have said a strike may have hit a massive truck bomb parked by the building. Others say families were either sheltering in a basement or had been forced inside.\"My initial assessment is that we probably had a role in these casualties,\" Townsend, the senior coalition commander in Iraq, told a Pentagon news briefing.\"What I don't know is were they (the civilians) gathered there by the enemy? We still have some assessments to do. ... I would say this, that it sure looks like they were.\"The incident has heightened fears for the safety of civilians - an important concern for Iraq's Shi'ite-led government as it tries to avoid alienating Mosul's mostly Sunni population.The United Nations rights chief said on Tuesday at least 307 civilians had been killed and 273 wounded in western Mosul since Feb. 17, saying Islamic State was herding residents into booby-trapped buildings as human shields and firing on those who tried to flee.

If granted, the 65-year-old will be held in detention for 20 days while she is investigated and possibly indicted on charges that could imprison her for at least 10 years.      If arrested, as a former president she will be assigned a cell that will be larger than the 6.56 square meter (71 square foot) solitary units occupied by others accused of wrongdoing in the same scandal, including the head of the Samsung conglomerate, Jay Y. Lee. \"I think Park would stay in a better facility,\" said Kim Kyung-soo, a retired prosecutor who interrogated two former military presidents, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, after their arrests in 1995 for treason and bribery. \"And she will use a bigger cell than those of others.\" Park will likely stay in a single cell in a remote building for security reasons to keep her separated from other inmates, the former prosecutors and prison officials said, but will be subject to the same rules on everything from meals to room inspections.That includes rising at about 6:30 a.m. and going to bed at around 9 p.m, and being allowed to watch television during the day but only a single channel with pre-recorded programs authorized by the Justice Ministry.Visitors are limited to one a day but detained inmates are allowed unlimited meeting time with their lawyers. The Korea Correctional Service, which operates the country's prisons and detention centers, lists a rotating set of meals that provide 2,500 calories a day.If Friday is her first day in detention, Park will be served a simple lunch of rice with bean sprouts, kimchi, cabbage stew and seaweed that costs 1,443 won ($1.30), officials said.NO CHIGNON?One of the other privileges Park will have to give up if arrested will be getting her hair coiffed in the cropped chignon style that is her trademark.Since taking office, Park has never been seen in public without a perfect chignon. She was last seen emerging after 14 hours of interrogation by prosecutors last week with the style intact.\"Getting your hair permed or done by someone from outside the facility is against equality among inmates,\" Kim, who now has a private law practice in Seoul, told Reuters. \"It will be difficult for (Park's side) to insist they need an outsider to come in and do her hair.\"Inmates have access to hairdressers inside but services are limited to cutting hair. Cosmetics at the detention center commissary are limited to the basics, like toner and lotion. Hair dye is also unavailable.Park will not be allowed to keep hairpins, lawyers who know about South Korea's correctional system said. It's not immediately clear which detention center from among the five in the Seoul metropolitan area will be used for Park if she is arrested. Choi and Samsung scion Lee, who is accused of giving bribes to Park for corporate favors, are being held at the Seoul Detention Centre, but officials there declined to comment on where Park will be taken if she is arrested.The center is however considered to be her most likely destination if the arrest warrant is issued.Lee Soon-gil, 77, a retired justice ministry official who was chief at the Seoul Detention Centre when Roh was held there, said the former president was given a bigger cell and a separate shower room and a toilet, whereas other inmates had wash stands and toilets inside their cells.Lee said officers redesigned an old cell, furnishing a desk and a bed for the former president, but the cells were inspected every day like others. \"She will be treated equally like anyone else,\" he said of Park.Samsung's Lee has no shower, only a wash-stand, in his cell and a mattress on the floor to sleep on.Kim, the retired prosecutor, said Park would have some benefits as a former president but no advantages.\"She is 65 and a woman, so in that regard she will be taken care of, but in the meantime she will be going through thorough investigations while being in there despite her age and status as a former president,\" he said.

A source within the government who did not wish to be named said the bill would set up a new committee that would set policies to \"support and protect Buddhism,\" though it wouldn't touch on religious practices.The bill would give monks chosen by the Sangha Council only three of the 27 seats on the committee. Other seats would go to the prime minister, police chief, a number of other senior officials as well as experts on Buddhism, members of Buddhist universities and representatives of Buddhist groups chosen by the prime minister, the source said.\"The bill does not 'support', but forces monks to obey and stay under state governance, which is inappropriate,\" Phra Metha Winairos, deputy dean of Mahamakut Buddhist University, told Reuters. \"This state interference will downgrade religion.\"The proposed law comes amid a swirl of controversies around a religion professed by 95 percent of Thais, and with most opposition to army rule neutralised since a 2014 coup.While police have lifted a three-week siege of the giant Dhammakaya temple north of Bangkok, the temple's defiance of attempts to arrest its former abbot in a money laundering case has highlighted the limit of state authority over monks.The draft of the new bill is being reviewed by the Sangha Supreme Council, said the head of the National Office of Buddhism.No member of the council of elder monks was available for comment. \"This bill will benefit monks and help spread Buddhism,\" said Pongporn Pramsaneh, the recently appointed former detective who now heads the government office that handles Buddhist affairs. He declined to give details about the bill.WANING INFLUENCEThere are already indications the Sangha Council's influence has been weakened.Last year, the junta rejected the name put forward by the council to be the new Supreme Patriarch of Buddhism, an abbot who had ties with the Dhammakaya temple and who had been under investigation over a scam involving luxury cars.The military-appointed parliament then granted new King Maha Vajiralongkorn the power to pick a chief monk himself.Pongporn at the Buddhist affairs office said the renewed push on the bill had nothing to do with the Dhammakaya temple, which frustrated an attempt by thousands of police this month to search for its former abbot, Phra Dhammachayo. Critics of the temple say it is sympathetic to the \"red shirt\" movement of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, which the temple denies.Paiboon Nititawan, a former junta advisor who wants even greater regulation of Buddhism, said if the bill was enacted, \"problems like Dhammakaya will be suppressed.\"\"Monks looking to violate monastic codes or wrongly exploit religion will be suppressed,\" he said.VOW OF OBEDIENCE?Religious scandal is nothing new in Thailand, which has 40,000 temples and more than 300,000 monks. Reports of sex, drugs and improper financial dealings are frequent.The proposed committee under the new bill would set policies to improve secular affairs - though not Buddhist religious practices. That could potentially help the Sangha tackle persistent problems, said Buddhism expert Montree Sirarojananan from Thammasat University in Bangkok. But he said a committee dominated by government officials could also be abused.\"A knife in the hands of a military government tends to be used as a weapon,\" he said. The bill did not include any measures for state control over the finances of temples which, according to a 2014 study, get an estimated $3.5 billion a year in donations, the government source said.The bill would still need approval from the cabinet and the legislative assembly.It would also need to be signed off by King Vajiralongkorn. After appointing a conservative as Supreme Patriarch in February, the king then approved the junta's request to strip the Dhammakaya temple's former abbot of his monastic titles.Aomsin Cheewapruek, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, said the government would enact the bill before the next general election, which is not expected until well into 2018.

The four reactors are part of two projects known as V.C. Summer in South Carolina, which is majority owned by SCANA Corp, and Vogtle in Georgia, which is owned by a group of utilities led by Southern Co.Costs for the projects have soared due to increased safety demands by U.S. regulators, and also due to significantly higher-than-anticipated costs for labor, equipment and components.Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse said it hopes to use bankruptcy to isolate and reorganize around its \"very profitable\" nuclear fuel and power plant servicing businesses from its money-losing construction operation.Westinghouse said in a court filing it has secured $800 million in financing from Apollo Investment Corp, an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, to fund its core businesses during its reorganization.For Toshiba, the filing will help keep the crisis-hit parent company afloat as it lines up buyers for its memory chip business, which could fetch $2 billion. Toshiba said Westinghouse-related liabilities totalled $9.8 billion as of December.    Toshiba said it would guarantee up to $200 million of the financing for Westinghouse. Toshiba shares closed up 2.2 percent but have lost half their value since the nuclear problems surfaced late last year.The Apollo loan needs court approval and is expected to carry Westinghouse for a year, people familiar with the matter said. The funds would support the company's global operations, including its healthier services and maintenance businesses, and pay for construction workers on site in Georgia and South Carolina, the people said.However, the money cannot be used to repay the liabilities stemming from cost overruns and delays at the projects, the people said. SCANA told investors on a conference call on Wednesday that 5,000 workers would continue working on its South Carolina site for 30 days while the company while it weighed options. \"Our preferred option is to finish the plants. The least preferred option is abandonment,\u201d said SCANA CEO Kevin Marsh.Southern Co said in a statement it would hold Westinghouse and Toshiba accountable for its contract. States regulators have approved costs of around $14 billion for each project but Morgan Stanley has estimated the final bill of around $22 billion for the South Carolina project and around $19 billion for the Georgia plant.POSSIBLE SALEWestinghouse\u2019s nuclear services business is expected to continue to perform profitably over the course of the bankruptcy and eventually be sold by Toshiba, people familiar with the matter said. They cautioned that the sale process will likely be highly complex and litigious. The bankruptcy could embroil the U.S. and Japanese governments, given the scale of the collapse and the $8.3 billion in U.S. government loan guarantees that were provided to help finance the reactors.A U.S. Department of Energy spokeswoman said the agency expects the parties to honor their commitments.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it was inspecting the sites to ensure the facilities met the requirements of the licenses that were issued to units of Southern and SCANA.Shares of SCANA were down 0.8 percent at $65.64 and Southern Co fell 0.4 percent to $49.90 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. NUCLEAR RENAISSANCEWhen regulators in Georgia and South Carolina approved the construction of Westinghouse's AP1000 reactors in 2009, it was meant to be the start of renewed push to develop U.S. nuclear power.However, a flood of cheap natural gas from shale, the lack of U.S. legislation to curb carbon emissions and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan dampened enthusiasm for nuclear power.Toshiba had acquired Westinghouse in 2006 for $5.4 billion. It expected to build dozens of its new AP1000 reactors - which were hailed as safer, quicker to construct and more compact - creating a pipeline of work for its maintenance division. NUCLEAR FALLOUTToshiba has said it expects to book a net loss of 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) for the fiscal year that ends Friday, one of the biggest annual losses in Japanese corporate history. Toshiba had earlier forecast a loss of 390 billion. Toshiba will close the first round of bids for its chip business - the world's second-biggest NAND chip producer - on Wednesday.    A source with knowledge of the issue said that about 10 potential bidders had shown interest, including Western Digital Corp which operates a Japanese chip plant with Toshiba, rival Micron Technology Inc, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc and financial investors.    Tsunakawa said offers for the unit are likely to allow Toshiba to maintain shareholder equity. Toshiba believes the unit will be worth at least 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), he added.The government-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, and Development Bank of Japan are expected to enter later bidding rounds as part of a consortium, sources said.A separate source said that Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, is expected to place an offer which is likely to be the highest bid. Other sources have said the Japanese government is likely to block a sale to Foxconn due to its deep ties with China.

More than 40 employees are being laid off, including some of the portfolio managers, according to another source.The company will also cut fees on some products that are being rebranded as an \"Advantage\" series of lower-cost active funds.Planned fee cuts on that group of funds and its \"Income\" products will slice about $30 million of BlackRock's revenue, and the company will take a $25 million charge this quarter to reflect severance and other compensation expenses.The company said it will also expand its investments in data-mining techniques that it said can improve investment performance. Other funds are being refocused to take \"high-conviction\" bets on stocks.Active stock managers in the United States have been smacked with withdrawals in recent years as investors increasingly fled to lower-cost products, including index-tracking exchange-traded funds, some of which charge as little as $3 annually for every $10,000 they manage, while the average charged by U.S. stock mutual fund managers is $131, according to data for 2015 from the Investment Company Institute trade group.An industry bellwether, New York-based BlackRock also owns one of the most prized businesses in asset management, its iShares ETF franchise purchased from Barclays in 2009. Much of the company's active stock franchise is from its 2006 acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers.The changes mark the latest of several attempts by BlackRock to boost an active fund business that represents nearly a third of its assets but an outsized near-50 percent of its fees.BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has sometimes expressed disappointment in the performance of the company's actively managed stock funds, and he has pivoted increasingly to focusing on the company's data-driven \"Scientific\" equity teams.\"It seems like the Vanguard approach to active equity management,\" said Jason Kephart, senior analyst at Morningstar Inc, referring to the giant BlackRock rival that aggressively cuts fees and has also invested in tech-driven investment styles.\"The easiest way to make an active strategy more attractive is just to charge less for it.\"BlackRock's equity overhaul also invites comparisons to  that of another major asset firm rival, Pacific Investment Management Co. In 2015, Pimco's equity chief left and the Newport Beach, Calif firm liquidated two of its equity strategies after spending years attempting to diversify its investor base to include those buying equity products.BlackRock shares rose 1.50 percent to $380.63 per share on Tuesday before the announcement.

But the European Commission objected, saying the deal, which was the pair's fifth attempt to combine, would have resulted in a monopoly in the processing of bond trades.Selling MTS, the LSE's Italian fixed income trading platform, would have removed the Commission's concerns but LSE declined to do so.\"How exactly these markets work and the products traded can seem like rocket science,\" said Vestager. \"But actually our competition concerns with this merger are very simple.\"  \"In some markets Deutsche B\u00f6rse and London Stock Exchange both provide the same services. And in some of these markets they are essentially the only players and the merger would therefore have led to a de facto monopoly.\"The EU rejection comes on the day the British government started proceedings for leaving the European Union, a move which industry sources have said undermined the merger plans. The Brexit decision had prompted German politicians to demand that the headquarters of the exchange group move from London to Frankfurt, creating a conflict that caused the deal to unravel.Further complicating the picture, German police and prosecutors had opened an investigation into possible insider trading by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Carsten Kengeter, the man who was set to lead the combined group.\"It is always the same,\" said one Deutsche Boerse manager, commenting on the long saga of the two exchanges trying to join together. \"Attempt to merge. Fall on your face. Save up money. Next merger attempt. Fall on your face,\" he said. While Wednesday's announcement marks the official end of the deal, there was already no hope left that it would go ahead  after the LSE took the unusual step last month of saying it would not accede to EU demands that MTS had to be sold if the deal was to be approved.Shares in the LSE were up 2 percent at 3,085 pence by 1130 GMT on Wednesday, after it announced a share buyback, while shares in Deutsche Boerse were up 1.7 percent at 83.23 euros.POWER STRUGGLEThe proposed merger threw a spotlight on clearing, whereby stock, bond and derivatives trades are completed, even if one side of the deal goes bust.The LSE's clearing arm, LCH, is one of the world's biggest, and the exchange had agreed to sell its LCH's Paris arm to French bourse Euronext if the merger went ahead. That sale will now not happen, the LSE said.This presents a problem for Euronext, which had opposed the tie up of London and Frankfurt, because it uses LCH in Paris to clear its own share trades under a deal that expires next year.Euronext Chief Executive Stephane Boujnah said on Wednesday that it was still willing to buy the business.\"But in the absence of obtaining an agreement, Euronext is fully committed to securing the best long-term solution for its post-trade activities,\" Boujnah said.LCH in London dominates the clearing of euro-denominated derivatives, an activity some EU policymakers want shifted to the euro zone to come under the supervision of the European Central Bank because Britain is leaving the EU.The bourse merger could have helped by shifting euro clearing to Deutsche Boerse's Eurex arm in Frankfurt. The collapse of the deal may now prompt the European Union to take action to engineer such a shift.

Tesla's shares rose 2.7 percent to $277.45 on Tuesday, closing in on Ford Motor Co (F.N) as the second-most-valuable U.S. auto company behind General Motors Co (GM.N).MORE STORIES FROM REUTERSTrump applauds Ford's previously planned investment in Michigan plantsBlack Tesla worker says he faced racist taunts, violent threatsGerman environmental lobby sues motor authority over VW scandalTencent also could help the U.S. company sell - or even build - cars in China, the world's largest auto market, analysts said.\"It certainly is a strong chess move for Tesla,\" said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for researcher LMC Automotive, citing the cash infusion and \"help in navigating the Chinese market.\"Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Tuesday tweeted: \"Glad to have Tencent as an investor and adviser to Tesla.\" Musk did not say what he meant by \"adviser\" but in a separate tweet he noted Tesla had \"very few\" Model 3 orders from China, where the car has not been formally introduced.The midsize Model 3 is due to go on sale later this year in the United States.The deal expands Tencent's presence in an emerging investment sector that includes self-driving electric cars, which could enable such new modes of transportation as automated ride-sharing and delivery services, as well as ancillary services ranging from infotainment to e-commerce.Those new technologies, and their potential to create new business models and revenue streams in the global transportation sector, have attracted billions in investment from China's three tech giants - Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O).In an investor note, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas said on Tuesday that he \"would not be surprised\" to see Tencent and Tesla collaborate in the development and deployment of some of those technologies.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Chinese investment in Tesla, but President Donald Trump has been critical of U.S. automakers and of China trade policies.Founded in 1998 by entrepreneur Ma Huateng, Tencent is one of Asia's largest tech companies, best known for its WeChat mobile messaging app. With a market capitalization of about $275 billion, it is roughly six times the size of 14-year-old Tesla, whose $45 billion market cap on Tuesday was only $1 billion shy of 114-year-old Ford.Tencent was an early investor in NextEV, a Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup that since has rebranded itself as Nio, with U.S. headquarters in San Jose, not far from Tesla's Palo Alto base. Tencent also has funded at least two other Chinese EV startups, including Future Mobility in Shenzhen.In addition, Tencent has invested in Didi Chuxing, the world's second-largest ride services company behind Uber, and in Lyft, Uber's chief U.S. rival.Baidu has invested in Nio, as well as in Uber and Velodyne, a California maker of laser-based lidar sensors for self-driving cars. Alibaba's mobility investments include Didi and Lyft.As Tesla is doing, many of the start-up companies backed by Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba are developing self-driving systems that eventually could be introduced in commercial ride-sharing fleets in the United States and China after 2020.Tencent maintains a U.S. office in Palo Alto, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. Beijing-based Baidu and Hangzhou-based Alibaba also maintain offices in Silicon Valley.Tencent owns about 8.2 million shares in Tesla, the carmaker said. It is the fifth-largest shareholder, behind Musk and investment companies Fidelity, Baillie Gifford and T.

It will also rescind a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, reverse rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production, and reduce the weight of climate change in federal agencies' assessments of new regulations.\"We're going to go in a different direction,\" a senior White House official told reporters ahead of Tuesday's order. \"The previous administration devalued workers with their policies. We can protect the environment while providing people with work.\"Trump will sign the order at the EPA with the agency's Administrator Scott Pruitt, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday afternoon. The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in Trump\u2019s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during his campaign for the presidency.\"I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration\u2019s commitment to the coal industry,\" Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters.PARIS ACCORD NOT ADDRESSED   Environmental groups have promised to challenge the orders.\"These actions are an assault on American values and they endanger the health, safety and prosperity of every American,\" said billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, the head of activist group NextGen Climate. Green group Earthjustice said it will fight the order both in and out of court. \u201cThis order ignores the law and scientific reality,\" said the group's president Trip Van Noppen. Trump campaigned on a promise to sweep aside green regulations he said hurt the economy, and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Since being elected, however, he has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it.The White House official said Trump's administration was discussing its approach to the accord, meant to limit the planet's warming by reducing carbon emissions.The order will direct the EPA to start a formal \"review\" process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but has never been implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican states. The review is likely to trigger legal challenges by environmental groups and some state attorneys general that could last years.The Clean Power Plan would have required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

Democrats charge the Russians wanted to tilt the election toward the Republican, a claim dismissed by Trump. Russia denies the allegations.MORE FROM REUTERS\u00a0 *\u00a0Breakingviews TV: Kushner's business\u00a0 *\u00a0Poll shows Macron win in French election\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0U.S. shale enlists genetics to boost outputBut there has been no doubt that the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, developed contacts among the Trump team. Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign on Feb. 13 after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.U.S. officials said that after meeting with Russian Kislyak at Trump Tower last December, a meeting also attended by Flynn, Kushner met later in December with Sergei Gorkov, chairman of Vnesheconombank.White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed the meetings, saying nothing of consequence was discussed.Gorkov was appointed head of VEB in early 2016 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He graduated from the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Russia\u2019s internal security agency. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Merit for Services to the Fatherland, according to the bank's website.According to two congressional staffers, some Senate investigators want to question Kushner and Flynn about whether they discussed with Gorkov or other Russian officials or financial executives the possibility of investing in 666 Fifth Avenue in New York or other Kushner Co or Trump properties if the new administration lifted the sanctions.VEB, aside from being under sanctions, has been grappling with bad debt after financing politically expedient projects such as construction for the Sochi Winter Olympics.It received 150 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) in support from the Russian budget in 2016, when its senior management was sacked and replaced by a team of executives from Russia's biggest lender Sberbank.In an article posted on Dec. 18, Forbes estimated that Jared Kushner, his brother Josh and his parents, Charles and Seryl, have a fortune of at least $1.8 billion, more than half of which Forbes estimates is held in real estate.Forbes did not provide a specific estimate for Jared Kushner\u2019s net worth on his own.\u00a0FOREIGN CONTACTSOn Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that Kushner is willing to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee chaired by U.S. Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican.\u201cThroughout the campaign and the transition, Jared served as the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials ... and so, given this role, he volunteered to speak with Chairman Burr's committee,\" Spicer told reporters at his daily briefing.The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate panel also said Kushner had agreed to be interviewed but no date had yet been scheduled.Simply meeting with representatives of a U.S.-sanctioned entity is not a violation of sanctions or against the law.Evgeny Buryakov, 41, a Russian citizen who worked at Vnesheconombank and whom U.S. authorities accused of posing as a banker while participating in a New York spy ring, pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge in March 2016. Buryakov admitted in federal court in Manhattan to acting as an agent for the Russian government without notifying U.S. authorities.He was prosecuted by the office of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan under Preet Bharara, who was among several chief prosecutors fired or asked to resign earlier this month by the new administration.\u00a0CLASSIFIED INFORMATIONAlso on Monday, a mystery rooted in Trump's claim that he was wiretapped by then President Barack Obama during the election campaign deepened with the disclosure that a top congressional Republican reviewed classified information on the White House grounds about potential surveillance of some Trump campaign associates.U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, visited the White House the night before he announced on Wednesday that he had information that indicated some Trump associates may have been subjected to some level of intelligence activity before Trump took office on Jan. 20.Democrats have said Nunes, who was a member of Trump's transition team, can no longer run a credible investigation of Russian hacking, the U.S. election and any potential involvement by Trump associates.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, have urged Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe.Nunes told CNN on Monday that he went to the White House grounds because the intelligence information was not available to Congress. He said he did not meet with Trump or his aides at that time and did not coordinate the release of information with the Trump administration.Nunes spokesman Jack Langer said in a statement that Nunes \"met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source.\"White House spokesman Spicer did not shed any light on who at the White House helped Nunes gain access to a secure location.It was the latest twist in a saga that began on March 4 when Trump said on Twitter without providing evidence that he \"just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory.\"FBI Director James Comey told Congress last Monday he had seen no evidence to support the claim.\u00a0(This version of the story corrects paragraph 1 to show that meeting was in December, not during 2016 presidential campaign. Paragraph 22 has also been corrected to show Buryakov pleaded guilty in March 2016, not Friday.)\u00a0(Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya and Polina Devitt in Moscow and Patricia Zengerle, Steve Holland, Mark Hosenball, John Walcott, Arshad Mohammed, Eric Beech and Warren Strobel in Washington; editing by Yara Bayoumy and Grant McCool)"},

Eyewitness from Western Mosul's al-Jadida district and Iraqi officials this week said a coalition air strike a week ago on IS targets may have collapsed homes where rescue officials say as many as 200 people were buried in the rubble.Conflicting accounts are emerging. But if confirmed, it would be one of the worst massacres since the 2003 U.S. invasion as Iraq's Shi'ite-led government tries to avoid alienating Mosul's mostly Sunni population.Already the battle around the Old City had slowed, forcing Iraqi forces and coalition allies to rethink how to push through tight, densely populated streets, where fleeing residents say they are used by militants as cover.\"We know that once the mosque falls this is the end of the Caliphate,\" said Staff Sgt Hassan, a Federal police sniper  watching the maze of houses below. \"But first we're trying to protect families coming out.\"Recapturing Mosul will deliver a major blow to Islamic State as preparations increase to retake its main base in Raqqa, Syria. Iraqi special forces, federal police, Kurdish forces and Shi'ite militias surround militants in Mosul, cutting off routes to Syria.Backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes and advisors, counter terrorism troops (CTS) captured eastern Mosul by January. Since then, CTS, federal police and rapid response brigades have pushed through about half of the west.In Islamic State-held areas, residents describe well-prepared militants who stayed behind. Some are foreign, some Iraqi. They force residents to leave their homes, breaking down walls to make tunnels. They make families retreat with them or herd them into buildings from which fighters fire on troops.\"They drive around on motorbikes looking for high positions on buildings, and they have tunnels between the homes,\" said Walid, a resident who fled from near the Old City. \"I saw one Russian, by his accent, he spoke only some Arabic.\"Even in retreat, militants are still dangerous. Two suicide bombers in an armored bulldozer plowed through military barricades two weeks ago, detonating the huge explosive-laden vehicle to destroy Humvees and Abrams tanks at one post.But the U.S.-led coalition say it has degraded Islamic State weaponry, jamming small drones they use to drop munitions, cratering roads where commanders suspect suicide bombers will speed into army positions, and targeting mortar crews.ANCIENT ALLEYSIn recent battles around the Old City, troops describe tough, street-by-street fighting in wrecked buildings, where narrow alleys are often cleared by grenades. Streets are blocked by earth barricades manned by tank crews and troops with shoulder-fired rockets to stop suicide attackers.Next comes Mosul's Old City, whose origins date back to the Assyrian empire and whose alleys, streets and ancient fortress walls reflect Roman, Ottoman and Persian conquests. Even people born there say they sometimes get lost.\"We sometimes don't see the enemy face to face,\" said Abu Taib, a federal police officer draped in ammunition. \"In the smaller alleys, we don't even go in, it's too dangerous. Sometimes we surprise them, sometimes they surprise us.\"That kind of terrain, and the risk of more civilian casualties prompted a rethink of tactics as Iraqi forces push to finish the Mosul campaign.U.S. Army Brigadier General John Richardson, a commander from the U.S.-led coalition, said Iraqi forces were considering isolating the Old City rather than fighting through it while opening up a second front to split militant ranks and clear the rest of Mosul.\"They know the old city is the center of gravity and they know they are going to have to eventually go in clear it. The mosque is symbolic,\" he said. \"They have run into some tougher resistance, but it's the terrain rather than the enemy.\"Federal police and Iraqi army sources also say initial plans are for the military to seal off the Old City and to evacuate civilians to allow U.S.-trained CTS special forces to take a larger role in carrying out incursions inside.Bringing the 9th Army division in from the north would also force Islamic State to fight on two fronts and draw fighters away from the Old City, where commanders fear civilian casualties may undermine security and fan the sectarian tensions that helped Islamic State thrive.HALT AIR STRIKESThe Jadida incident is already complicating the campaign. Rescue workers are still searching the site of the March 17 explosion, where one health official said 160 bodies had been recovered. Iraq's military says 61 bodies have been pulled out so far.Eyewitnesses describe a massive explosion that collapsed buildings and buried residents inside. But what caused the blast is unclear. The U.S.-led coalition said it carried out a strike on IS targets in the area but is still investigating.The Pentagon said later it was not loosening its rules of engagement in the fight against Islamic State but that resources to investigate claims were limited.Iraq's military said Islamic State boobytrapped a building packed with civilians and fired from it to draw an air strike. But it said there was no sign an air strike hit the collapsed building. Other eyewitnesses say an air strike may have hit a truck bomb, which exploded and destroyed nearby buildings.Already Sunni lawmakers are questioning the campaign. Iraqi Parliament speaker Salim\u00a0al-Jabouri told al-Arabiya television that more civilian casualties could result in a halt to operations until a way to protect residents is found. \"The international community should step in and save Mosul from blind air strikes,\" Mosul lawmaker Faris al-Sanjari told Reuters. \"You can't kill dozens of civilians just to kill one Islamic State sniper.\"  (Additional Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed in Baghdad; editing by Giles Elgood)"},

Forecasters said high winds would likely persist overnight, although the storm would then weaken rapidly and was expected to be downgraded to category one by dawn on Wednesday.Police said one man was badly hurt when a wall collapsed at Proserpine, about 900 km (560 miles) northwest of the Queensland capital, Brisbane, and was taken to hospital.But the weather was still too bad to assess damage fully or mount an emergency response.\"We will also receive more reports of injuries, if not deaths. We need to be prepared for that,\" Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart told reporters in Brisbane.As the storm forged slowly inland after nightfall, state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk urged people to stay indoors.\"It is a serious event and we do not want to see loss of life,\" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\"It will be a difficult night for people across our state.\"Cyclone Debbie made landfall at Airlie Beach, north of Proserpine, shortly after midday local time (0200 GMT), knocking out telephone services.\"It's very noisy: Screaming, howling wind ... sounds like a freight train,\" Jan Clifford told Reuters by text from Airlie Beach as the cyclone made landfall.\"Still blowing like crazy,\" she said four hours later.Authorities had urged thousands of people in threatened areas to flee their homes on Monday, in what would have been the biggest evacuation seen in Australia since Cyclone Tracy devastated the northern city of Darwin on Christmas Day, 1974.    CATASTROPHE DECLAREDTorrential rain flooded streets and wind smashed windows, uprooted trees and tossed debris down streets, while jetties at Airlie Beach marina were wrecked, Nine Network television pictures showed.Power was cut for 48,000 people in a wide area between the towns of Bowen and Mackay, north and south of Airlie Beach,  Ergon Energy spokesman John Fowler said.Ports at Abbot Point, Mackay and Hay Point were shut and Townsville airport was closed. Airlines Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia suspended flights to and from the region and said planes may also be grounded on Wednesday, although Townsville airport said it would reopen.   BHP Billiton and Glencore halted work at their coal mines in the storm's path.The Insurance Council of Australia declared Cyclone Debbie a catastrophe, making it easier to make claims, but said in a statement it was too early to estimate the cost of damage.With an eye 50 km (30 miles) wide, the cyclone had earlier damaged tourist resorts, washed away beaches and tore boats from moorings as it swept through the Whitsunday islands, guests told Reuters by telephone.Cyclone Debbie is the strongest storm to hit Queensland since Cyclone Yasi destroyed homes and crops and devastated island resorts in 2011.    Authorities had feared tidal surges in low-lying areas as the storm whipped up waves and currents and lifted sea levels, but said later that danger had eased.Holidaymakers tried to make the best of it as they bunkered down in resort buildings. \"Go to the Whitsundays they said, it'd be fun they said, beautiful weather over here,\" holidaymaker Kurt Moore told the Sydney Morning Herald.\"I'm so glad we got evacuated out of the place we were staying at, I think we'd be pooping watermelons right now to be honest,\" he said.    Despite issuing evacuation orders, police said they were not sure how many people had heeded their advice.That did not deter some thrill-seeking bodyboarders who paddled out to surf in the heaving seas at Airlie Beach, television footage showed.

It had also constructed hardened shelters with retractable roofs for mobile missile launchers at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief and enough hangars at Fiery Cross for 24 combat aircraft and three larger planes, including bombers.U.S. officials told Reuters last month that China had finished building almost two dozen structures on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross that appeared designed to house long-range surface-to-air missiles.In his Senate confirmation hearing in January, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson angered China by saying it  should be denied access to islands it had built up in the South China Sea.Tillerson subsequently softened his language, saying that in the event of an unspecified \"contingency,\" the United States and its allies \"must be capable of limiting China's access to and use of\" those islands to pose a threat.In recent years, the United States has conducted a series of what it calls freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, raising tensions with Beijing.

Here's how:EU BUDGET: WHERE'S THE MONEY GONE?The Union's budget accounts for only 2 percent of public spending in the bloc. But in the east, transfers from Brussels contribute a much bigger share - some 8 percent of Poland's budget and nearly a fifth of Bulgaria's. Without Britain, Brussels will have about a sixth less to give to countries that are net recipients, setting up a fight between east and west over a 7-year spending plan from 2021. In the short term, there will also be a battle with Britain over what it owes on leaving. London may choose to keep paying for access to some key EU budgets, such as for research. But big accounts, like farm subsidies, could be in for radical review.BALANCE OF POWER: FRIENDS LEFT IN LURCHBritain has used its 12-percent share of EU votes to curb Brussels spending and push hard for free trade. Its departure worries smaller northern allies like the Nordics and Dutch.Poorer easterners, whose membership Britain championed, fret that Germany and France may stiffen barriers to their low-wage workforce or beef up EU federal powers the ex-communist states dislike. Aspiring new members, notably in the Balkans, also lose an ally against rich westerners wary of further EU enlargement.The 19 euro countries will lose a key block on their caucus power. They can now outvote non-euro states, but only just. A non-euro bloc led by Poland and Sweden would need major dissent among euro countries to prevent the euro zone setting EU policy.France becomes the EU's only nuclear-armed, veto-wielding U.N. Security Council member and loses a dogged opponent of its ambitions for more EU defense cooperation outside the U.S.-led NATO alliance; defense is already back on Brussels' agenda.Germany, ambivalent about being seen as dominating Europe by dint of its economic muscle and being home to nearly one post-Brexit EU citizen in five, is uneasy about how to maintain balance, notably with economically struggling co-founder France. EU IN THE WORLD: A DIMINISHED FORCEThe EU loses a hefty interlocutor with the United States and the wider English-speaking world. A historic diplomatic and military force, Britain's insight and influence with powers like China and Russia or in the Middle East have been useful to the EU. In Africa, a source of growing concern over migration, British aid budgets and other clout have played a key role.London's tough line with Moscow has won it friends among the likes of the Baltic states and the Netherlands, which fear that a softer approach from France, Italy and, possibly, Germany will undermine a consensus for pressuring Russia with sanctions over its actions in Ukraine or for cutting dependence on Russian gas.POLITICAL CULTURE: VIVE LE BREXIT?Though under-represented in the staff of EU institutions, British officials over 44 years of membership have established a key role in senior positions as well as in the EU parliament. That will disappear as British citizens are shut out of EU jobs.Many governments, notably from smaller states, value what they see as a British approach to administration that is more pragmatic and laissez-faire than the more centralized, dirigiste tradition embedded in the French foundations of the Union.Britain will leave one legacy likely to survive in the form of English as Brussels' working language, despite some hopes in Paris of restoring the prominence of French.    SURVIVAL GAME: BREAKING THE BREAK-UP TABOOSince the Brexit vote, EU leaders speak of a renewed unity among the remaining 27. Polls suggest popular support for the EU has broadly increased. But unity will be sorely tested by Brexit negotiations, with governments all having differing priorities.The unprecedented use of Article 50 of the EU treaty breaks a taboo and means invocations of an \"indivisible Union\" now ring hollow. Brussels will have to contend with more threats to quit, coloring decision-making across the board for years to come.   (Additional reporting by Waverly Colville; editing by Andrew Roche)"},

It comes amid mounting U.S. concerns about additional missile and nuclear tests, potentially in the near future.Several U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the test took place on Friday night and the engine could possibly be used in an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Earlier this month North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country had conducted a test of a new high-thrust engine at its Tongchang-ri rocket launch station, saying it was \"a new birth\" of its rocket industry.At the time, North Korea's official media said the engine would help it achieve world-class satellite launch capability, indicating the test was of a new type of rocket engine for long-range missiles.Kim also has said North Korea is close to an ICBM test-launch.North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a liftoff, experts have said.Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from the North.

Now, U.S. shale producers can compete in a $50-per-barrel oil market, and about a dozen shale companies are seeking to cut costs further by analyzing DNA samples extracted from oil wells to identify promising spots to drill.The technique involves testing DNA extracts from microbes found in rock samples and comparing them to DNA extracted from oil. Similarities or differences can pinpoint areas with the biggest potential. The process can help cut the time needed to begin pumping, shaving production costs as much as 10 percent, said Ajay Kshatriya, chief executive and co-founder of Biota Technology, the company that developed this application of DNA science for use in oilfields.The information can help drillers avoid missteps that prevent maximum production, such as applying insufficient pressure to reach oil trapped in rocks, or drilling wells too closely together, Kshatriya said.\"This is a whole new way of measuring these wells and, by extension, sucking out more oil for less,\" he said.Biota's customers include Statoil ASA, EP Energy Corp and more than a dozen other oil producers. Kshatriya would not detail Biota's cost, but said it amounts to less than 1 percent of the total cost to bring a well online.A shale well can cost between $4 million and $8 million, depending on geology and other factors.Independent petroleum engineers and chemists said Biota's process holds promise if the company can collect enough DNA samples along the length of a well so results are not skewed.\"I don't doubt that with enough information (Biota) could find a signature, a DNA fingerprint, of microbial genomes that can substantially improve the accuracy and speed of a number of diagnostic applications in the oil industry,\" said Preethi Gunaratne, a professor of biology and chemistry at the University of Houston.Biota has applied its technology to about 80 wells across U.S. shale basins, including North Dakota's Bakken, and the Permian and Eagle Ford in Texas, Kshatriya said. That is a tiny slice of the more than 300,000 shale wells across the nation.EP Energy, one of Biota's first customers, insisted on a blind test last year to gauge the technique's effectiveness, asking Biota to determine the origin of an oil sample from among dozens of wells in a 1,000-square foot zone.Biota was able to find the wells from which the oil was taken and to recommend improvements for wells drilled in the same region, said Peter Lascelles, an EP Energy geologist.\"If you've been in the oilfield long enough, you've seen a lot of snake oil,\" said Lascelles, using slang for products or services that do not perform as advertised.Lascelles said DNA testing helps EP Energy understand well performance better than existing oil field surveys such as seismic and chemical analysis. The testing gives insight into what happens underground when rock is fractured with high pressure mixtures of sand and water to release trapped oil.Biota's process is just the latest technology pioneered to coax more oil from rock. Other techniques include microseismic studies, which examine how liquid moves in a reservoir, and tracers, which use some DNA elements to study fluid movement.Venture capitalist George Coyle said his fund Energy Innovation Capital had invested in Biota because it expected the technique to yield big improvements in drilling efficiency. He declined to say how much the fund had invested.\"The correlations they're going to be able to find to improve a well, we think, are going to be big,\" he said. -For graphic on 'DNA sequencing in the oil industry' click: tinyurl.com/ma8ypwd (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Gary McWilliams, Simon Webb and David Gregorio)"},

Samsung's Note 7s were permanently scrapped in October after some phones self-combusted, prompting a global recall roughly two months after the launch of the near-$900 devices.A subsequent investigation found manufacturing problems in batteries supplied by two companies - Samsung SDI Co and Amperex Technology.Analysis from Samsung and independent researchers found no other problems in the Note 7 devices except the batteries, raising speculation that Samsung will recoup some of its losses by selling refurbished Note 7s.A person familiar with the matter told Reuters in January that it was considering the possibility of selling refurbished versions of the device or reusing some parts.Samsung's announcement that revamped Note 7s will go back on sale, however, surprised some with the timing - only days before it launches its new S8 smartphone on Wednesday in the United States, its first new premium phone since the debacle last year.Under pressure to turn its image around after the burning battery scandal, Samsung had previously not commented on its plans for recovered phones.\"Regarding the Galaxy Note 7 devices as refurbished phones or rental phones, applicability is dependent upon consultations with regulatory authorities and carriers as well as due consideration of local demand,\" Samsung said in a statement.South Korea's Electronic Times newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said on Tuesday that Samsung will start selling refurbished Note 7s in its home country in July or August and will aim to sell between 400,000 and 500,000 of the Note 7s using safe batteries. Samsung said in a statement to Reuters that the company has not set specifics on refurbished Note 7 sales plans, including what markets and when they would go on sale, though it also said it does not plan to sell refurbished Note 7s in India or the United States.   The company said refurbished Note 7s will be equipped with new batteries that have gone through Samsung's new battery safety measures.    \"The objective of introducing refurbished devices is solely to reduce and minimize any environmental impact,\" it said.  The company estimated that it took a profit hit of $5.5 billion over three quarters because of the Note 7's troubles. It had sold more than 3 million of the phones before taking the model off the market.Samsung also plans to recover and use or sell reusable components such as chips and camera modules, as well as rare metals such as copper, gold, nickel and silver from Note 7 devices it opts not to sell as refurbished products. Environment rights group Greenpeace and others had urged Samsung to come up with environmentally friendly ways to deal with the recovered Note 7s. Greenpeace said in a separate statement on Monday that it welcomed Samsung's decision and that the company should carry out its plans in a verifiable manner.

The deal is one of a trio of mega mergers that will reshape the industry and consolidate six companies into three.Asset sales would ensure competition in the sector and benefit European farmers and consumers, the Commission said.\"We need effective competition in this sector so companies are pushed to develop products that are ever safer for people and better for the environment,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\"Our decision today ensures that the merger between Dow and DuPont does not reduce price competition for existing pesticides or innovation for safer and better products in the future.\"The two other big deals in the industry are ChemChina's [CNNCC.UL] $43 billion bid for Syngenta and Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto.Dow and DuPont said they were still on target for $3 billion in cost synergies and $1 billion in growth benefits.The deal is still to be approved by regulators in the United States, Brazil, China, Australia and Canada, but the companies said they were confident of clearance in all remaining jurisdictions.\"This regulatory milestone is a significant step toward closing the merger transaction, with the intention to subsequently spin into three independent publicly traded companies,\" Dow spokeswoman Rachelle Schikorra said in an email.The EU approval may be a sign that U.S. regulators would follow suit because the agencies have traditionally coordinated on reviews and remedies for large multinational mergers, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute non-profit group.However, any required asset sales would likely reflect antitrust concerns in the local marketplace.\"In the U.S., there are very high shares in corn and soybean seeds. We would expect those problems to be significant enough for enforcers in the U.S. to remedy them,\" Moss said.WEIGHTY DECISIONThe 1,000-page decision underlined the significance of the merger. In return for the EU green light, DuPont will divest large parts of its global pesticides business, including its global research and development organization. The unit makes herbicides for cereals, oilseed rape, sunflower, rice and pasture and insecticides for insect control for fruits and vegetables.Dow, in turn, will sell two acid co-polymer manufacturing facilities in Spain and the United States, as well as a contract with a third party through which it buys ionomers. The company has already found a buyer in South Korea's SK Innovation.\"The main surprises here are the inclusion of the pesticides and the exclusion of any kind of seed assets,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note. The analysts also said they had expected EU to be concerned about the concentration of seed sales, and that they would require Dow to divest its corn seeds business.\"We see the required divestments here as smaller than we originally expected, due to the exclusion of seed assets\".Antitrust experts said the regulator's demand to sell large swathes of R&D; facilities could set the benchmark for future deals.Lobbying group Friends of the Earth Europe criticized the EU decision, saying that the three deals would lead to three companies controlling about 70 percent of the world's agrichemicals and more than 60 percent of commercial seeds.\"This decision to allow Dow Chemicals and DuPont to form the world's biggest agribusiness company will give giant corporations an even tighter toxic grip on our food and countryside. For the public and nature such mergers are marriages made in hell,\" said Adrian Bebb from Friends of the  Earth Europe.The agriculture company it planned to create with DuPont will be able to serve farmers better, helped by leveraging strong pipeline in its seeds and chemistry business, and competitive prices, Dow's Schikorra said. \"We're concerned about the signal this sends for U.S. approval. We're concerned about further consolidation in an already highly concentrated industry,\" said Barbara Patterson, director of government relations for the National Farmers Union, which represents 200,000 U.S. farmers and ranchers.Sources said last week that ChemChina's [CNNCC.UL] bid for Syngenta could be approved this week but the timing could slip.

The Raiders will play the 2017, 2018 and possibly 2019 seasons in Oakland before kicking off the 2020 season in Las Vegas, Davis said. It marks the second time Oakland fans will see the Raiders leave the city where they began play in 1960 in the old American Football League.The team, known for its black and silver uniforms and working-class appeal, played in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994 before returning to Oakland. The team won two Super Bowl championships in Oakland in 1977 and 1981 and one in Los Angeles in 1984. Oakland is also about to lose the Golden State Warriors National Basketball Association team, which is building an arena in neighboring San FranciscoDavis acknowledged some fans in Oakland would be disappointed and even angry at the decision, but said frustration should be directed at him and not the team's coaches or players.  He said his goal in the meantime was to \"bring a championship back to Oakland.\"MOVE HAD BEEN IN DOUBTThe Las Vegas relocation plan appeared to be all but dead after casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and later Goldman Sachs (GS.N) changed their minds earlier this year about helping to finance the stadium construction. Adelson had pledged up to $650 million toward construction of the domed stadium but pulled his support in January after the team presented a lease proposal without his knowledge. The Raiders secured financing to replace Adelson's portion from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).An additional $750 million will come from public funds via a visitor's tax on Las Vegas strip hotel rooms.    The Raiders will become the second major professional sports franchise to be based in Las Vegas. The National Hockey League's Vegas Golden Knights begin playing in the 2017-18 season.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf made an 11th-hour push over the weekend to convince the owners and the NFL to delay the vote so she could promote a plan to keep the team in Oakland. It  included a new, $1.3 billion stadium. The plan would also have set aside land for the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which currently shares the 51-year-old Oakland Coliseum with the Raiders. \"We had a fully financed, shovel-ready project that was a public-private partnership and we are incredibly disappointed that was not selected,\" Schaaf told a news conference on Monday.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said there were too many unanswered questions surrounding the Oakland stadium plan for it to be viable.\"We understand that contingencies sometimes occur but major contingencies that put the entire project into doubt are just unreasonable,\" he said at a new conference, citing issues about where the stadium would be located and the fate of the Athletics, who are seeking a new ballpark.

It was not immediately clear if the review had reached the Republican president's desk or how quickly he would decide on a course of action, which could be delayed by the slow pace at which the administration is filling key national security jobs.The White House declined comment.Trump told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday that the United States was prepared to respond to North Korean nuclear threats on its own if China fails to pressure Pyongyang.Trump made clear he would he would urge China to use its influence with North Korea when he meets Xi at his Florida resort on Thursday and Friday for their first face-to-face meeting.The review, which was led by national security adviser H.R. McMaster, proposes a multi-pronged approach aimed at tightening the screws on North Korea economically and militarily, the official said. It will be up to Trump to decide how and when to proceed, and he could also send the review back for further work, the official said.While most details remained under wraps, senior U.S. officials told Reuters recently that options under consideration included tougher sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system, which could entail \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang.The U.S. official said Trump may warn Xi of such moves, including efforts to beef up South Korean and Japanese anti-missile defenses \u2013 something Beijing strongly opposes.The Chinese have urged Washington to de-escalate tensions with Pyongyang and to find a way to restart negotiations, but U.S. officials say it would  be premature to resume talks now because it would be seen as a reward to North Korea for bad behavior.The chief U.S. concern is North Korea\u2019s efforts to develop an intercontinental nuclear missile that could carry a nuclear warhead and be capable of hitting the United States.Although the long-standing option of pre-emptive military strikes against North Korea is not off the table, the review  gives priority to less-risky steps and \u201cde-emphasizes direct military action,\u201d the official said.Other steps that have been under consideration are escalating cyber attacks and other covert action aimed at undermining North Korea's leadership, another U.S. source said recently.

While the court backed off its Wednesday decision to fully take over the legislative branch, it left in place sweeping new authority for Maduro to cut oil deals on behalf of PDVSA, the state-run oil company, without congressional approval.Maduro's cash-strapped government now has the autonomy to sell stakes in Venezuela's oil fields, which contain the world's largest reserves, or launch new joint ventures with foreign firms.The court action sets the stage for a protracted legal and political fracas that could spook foreign investors and further undermine the nation's efforts to stabilize PDVSA, said opposition lawmakers and industry experts. The state-run firm is already reeling from lower oil prices, a cash-flow crisis and chronic operational problems that have crippled its ability to serve customers worldwide.The fight centers on a constitutional requirement that the National Assembly approve PDVSA contracts of \"national public interest\" with outside companies. In addition to Maduro's legislative opponents, Venezuela's attorney general - a longtime government ally - has called the court decision to bypass the assembly unconstitutional.The legislature - which has been controlled by members opposing Maduro's government since late last year - has warned investors that oil deals would be invalid without assembly approval. Opposition lawmakers slammed state-run Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM), for instance, after it paid $500 million last year to increase its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture, to 40 percent from 16.7 percent, without legislative approval. Rosneft - a major PDVSA partner at a time when relations between Caracas and Moscow have grown increasingly cozy - said the deal was legal. But the episode underscored the potential legal quagmire for investors. Following the court's action on Saturday, opposition leaders vowed to continue challenging the validity of oil deals it has not approved. \"This is desperation for dollars,\" opposition lawmaker Elias Matta, the vice-president of the congressional energy and oil commission, told Reuters. \"Let it be clear that any company created under this scheme will be null - totally null.\"  Venezuela's Information and Oil Ministries, along with PDVSA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.NERVOUS INVESTORSThe imbroglio could hamper investments from wary multinational companies, especially those that are subject to stricter regulatory scrutiny at home. On Thursday, National Assembly head Julio Borges tore up the Supreme Court order on the steps of the legislature, an image likely to unsettle corporate boardrooms. Other major oil players in Venezuela include U.S. major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and China's state-owned CNPC. Investor uncertainty, in turn, could further undermine Venezuela's ravaged economy, which depends on PDVSA for more than 90 percent of export revenue as millions face food shortages and runaway inflation.In theory, the court's decision would allow Maduro's government the power to do anything short of privatizing PDVSA without approval of the National Assembly, said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin America energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston. \"But the legal ground could not be shakier if there is a change in government,\" he said. \"As a result of all this international scandal, foreign investors will be less likely to invest.\"$3 BILLION IN BOND PAYMENTSFirebrand Hugo Chavez, president until he died in 2013, led a wave of oil nationalizations in Venezuela as part of his self-styled \"21st century Socialism.\" The policies have left many oil fields less productive and lacking investment. National oil output tumbled last year on the back of constant refinery outages, an outflow of talent, and shortages of basic equipment in oil fields and imported diluents needed for blending with Venezuela's heavy crude.Amid mounting debts, Venezuela has sought to sell stakes in oil fields to bolster its dwindling coffers before a deadline to pay about $3 billion in bond obligations this month, sources say.On Friday, Venezuelan bonds tanked on worries about the impact of the latest crisis on the country's credit-worthiness.It is unclear if the initial Supreme Court decision - the one that sparked global outrage - was prompted by an imminent plan to sell an oil field stake or create a new oil venture.   Reuters reported in March that PDVSA was negotiating a business deal with Rosneft and had offered the state-led company a stake in the Petropiar joint venture.The offer has not been confirmed, and it remains unclear if Rosneft, which has become an increasingly key source of financing for PDVSA, is interested. PDVSA is also relying on Rosneft to help it meet its looming bond payments, Reuters reported on Friday. It is unclear if the deal will go through or what Rosneft might get in exchange.Late last year, Venezuela used 49.9 percent of its shares in U.S. subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loan financing from Rosneft. The move enraged opposition politicians who argue a desperate government is mortgaging prized national assets. PDVSA and the Oil Ministry have not responded to repeated requests for comment on potential deals with Rosneft. Rosneft has declined to comment.

Compliance with the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC producers at the end of last year to cut supply is \"encouraging,\" Barkindo told the forum.General compliance with supply cuts by the oil producers was 86 percent in January and 94 percent in February, he added.   The market is already balancing, Barkindo said, adding stocks of crude were coming down.Luaibi said he was satisfied with the existing deal, but declined to say whether Iraq would support an extension, leaving it to an OPEC ministerial meeting planned in May.The current deal, he said, \"contains many positive elements and achieved a lot of targets; work is ongoing to reach the reduction of 1.8\" million barrels per day (bpd) agreed by OPEC and 11 other nations including Russia for their combined production in the first half of 2017.The accord has lifted crude to about $50 a barrel. But the price gain has also encouraged U.S. shale oil producers, which are not part of the pact, to boost output.  While Iraq is committed to achieving 100 percent of its target reduction, it will proceed with projects to boost oil production capacity to 5 million barrels per day before the end of the year, Luaibi said.OPEC's second-largest producer, after Saudi Arabia, Iraq will proceed in parallel with exploration plans to increase its reserves by 15 billion barrels in 2018, to reach 178 billion barrels, he said.Among the plans to increase output capacity from existing fields is a sea water injection plan which is in process of being tendered, he added.Iraq's oil production has averaged 4.464 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in March, a reduction of more than 300,000 bpd on levels before OPEC cuts were implemented from Jan. 1, state-oil marketer SOMO said on Thursday.Average crude exports were 3.756 million bpd in March, versus a record of more than 4 million bpd in November, according to SOMO.Most of Iraq's crude is exported from southern ports, the region where it is produced. Exports from the south averaged 3.2 million bpd in March, Luaibi said. Barkindo described as \"very constructive\" meetings he had on Saturday with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other Iraqi leaders in Baghdad.Iraq's natural gas output will triple to 1,700 million cubic feet per day (cfd) by 2018, as it implements projects to reduce flaring, Luaibi told the conference.

In January, Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion car factory in Mexico and instead added 700 jobs in Michigan following Trumps criticism that centered on trade and investing in America.Ford said on Tuesday it would spend $850 million on a planned upgrade of a plant in Wayne, Michigan, for the Ford Bronco, an SUV model, and the Ford Ranger - a mid-size pickup truck. The company will also invest $150 million and create 130 or retain jobs at an engine plant in Romeo.Both projects were part of 2015 negotiations with the UAW, when Ford said it would invest $9 billion in U.S. plants over four years.Ford also said it would invest $200 million in a data center in Flat Rock to support advances in vehicle connectivity and future developments in autonomous vehicles, but it will not result in any new hourly jobs.The move comes at a time when U.S. new car and truck sales are at an all-time high and investors are watching closely for signs of a possible downturn in the highly-cyclical industry.\"We're optimistic that we'll continue to see good economic growth for the U.S. in the near term,\" Joe Hinrichs, president of the Americas at Ford, told Reuters. \"We feel very confident about our plan and our products and about investing in Michigan and the U.S.\"Separately, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) approved nearly $30 million in state incentives for Ford over 15 years at a meeting Tuesday. Ford will use the incentives to partially defray the costs of the improvements.The MEDC noted that Ford had considered locating some of the jobs in Mexico, where it is cheaper to employ workers. \"Incentive assistance was necessary to ensure the project moves forward in Michigan,\" the MEDC said.The announcement by Ford on Tuesday comes less than two weeks after Trump visited Detroit to promise more auto jobs for Michigan and other Midwestern U.S. states.Trump pounced on Ford's announcement before the company could release its plans on Tuesday.\"Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants,\" Trump posted on Twitter early Tuesday. \"Car companies coming back to U.S.  JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!\"Trump has at times promoted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced. Last week he praised an investment decision by Charter Communications Inc that the company announced before he was elected.Steve Rattner, who was an automotive policy adviser under President Barack Obama, remarked on Twitter that Trump was misleading people about jobs, saying \"the big news ended up being only 130 jobs in (Michigan) that were announced back in 2015.\"Ford said last week it expected higher investments, as well as other spending, to weigh on 2017 earnings.U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. On Friday, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive maintained their 2017 sales forecast of 17.6 million vehicles, an increase of 0.2 percent from 2016. But they said automakers' incentive spending in the United States in the first half of March had hit a record for the month, breaking the previously set mark in March 2009 during the height of the Great Recession.On Monday, Moody's Investors service said it expected U.S. new vehicle sales to dip in 2017 and warned of a \"significant credit risk\" for auto lenders as competition for loans intensifies.Trump has focused on U.S. automotive jobs, meeting with company executives as well as pressuring - and praising - them on Twitter. Executives have also said they hope his administration will pursue tax and regulatory policies that would benefit U.S. manufacturers.Trump has repeatedly suggested automakers will build new plants in the United States, but no company has plans to do so.In late trading Tuesday, Ford shares were up 2.1 percent at $11.69.

The lawsuit was filed on Monday in California state court.Lambert, 44, said other production workers routinely made racist and sexually charged comments to him, and when he complained, they falsely accused him of various infractions. He also claims he was passed over for promotions because of his race.The races of Lambert's coworkers were not clear from the complaint. A Tesla spokesman, in a statement, said several employees were fired after the company investigated Lambert's complaints and that he is currently suspended with pay. But the company also said Lambert was friendly with the coworkers he claims harassed him before a falling out, and that he also used racial epithets and made threats.The spokesman said Lambert was promoted last year and did not receive a second promotion because he posted a picture taken inside the plant on Facebook, in violation of company policy.\"The lawsuit has been timed to coincide with a carefully planned media blitz in an attempt to create a disingenuous narrative that is at odds with the facts,\" said the spokesman, who requested anonymity, citing company policy.In his lawsuit, Lambert says other Tesla workers were not disciplined after posting photos taken inside the plant on social media. He claims Tesla violated California labor laws prohibiting racial discrimination, harassment and retaliation, and is seeking unspecified damages.The complaint comes one month after a female Tesla engineer filed a lawsuit in California state court claiming she was sexually harassed, paid less than her male colleagues and passed over for promotions because of her sex. In October, a 69-year-old former Tesla engineer filed an age discrimination lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco saying he was unfairly criticized by younger supervisors and coworkers, and ultimately fired, because of his age.The recent case is Lambert v.

They are difficult options. Let me be very frank, it's not easy, they are difficult choices that have to be made,\" Tillerson told a joint news conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.Cavusoglu said Washington accepted there was no difference between the YPG militia and the PKK. Tillerson condemned recent PKK attacks in Turkey but made no such acknowledgement.He said his talks focused on the creation of \"stabilization zones\" in Syria so refugees could return home and that a number of options on how to secure such areas were being explored.Turkey, sheltering more than 2 million Syrians, has long called for such safe areas but the idea has gained little traction among Western allies who question how such zones can be carved out without a significant foreign military presence.STRAINED TIESTillerson's visit comes at a difficult time in U.S.-Turkish relations. Ties soured under former U.S. President Barack Obama and officials in Ankara have been hoping for a reset under Donald Trump, but there have been few signs of improvement.Aside from differences over Syria, relations have also been strained by the continued presence in the United States of Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Erdogan for a failed coup last July and whom Ankara wants extradited.Cavusoglu said Turkey expects Washington to take concrete steps on Gulen's extradition, including his temporary detention. U.S. officials have in the past said that is a matter for the U.S. judicial system.Tillerson's trip was further clouded by the arrest in New York on Monday of an executive of Turkey's state-run Halkbank (HALKB.IS), who is accused of conspiring with Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab in a multi-year scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.Cavusoglu described the arrest of the banker as a \"political\" move and said the U.S. attorney who launched the case against Zarrab had close ties with Gulen's supporters.Tillerson's visit comes less than three weeks ahead of a referendum at which Erdogan is seeking constitutional change to boost his powers, a move which his opponents and some European allies fear will bring increasing authoritarianism.Tillerson did not meet members of the Turkish opposition during his visit, apparently avoiding domestic issues while trying to keep the focus on the fight against Islamic State.It was a change in tone from U.S. visits under Obama. Then Vice President Joe Biden said during a Jan. 2016 visit that Turkey was setting a poor example for the region by intimidating the media and curtailing internet freedoms.

In that time, tens of thousands of EU-related laws have made their way onto the British statute book, governing almost everything from farming to finance.Her ministers laid out how they intend to unpick that complex legislative web by initially converting the entire body of EU law into British law - a step seen as necessary to ensure continuity for businesses trading across EU borders.The plan centers around a \"Great Repeal Bill\" due to be laid before parliament in May. The bill will transpose EU law, repeal the 1972 European Communities Act which formalizes Britain's EU membership, and give ministers the power to change existing laws to make sure they work after Brexit.\"The bill will convert EU law into United Kingdom law, allowing businesses to continue operating knowing the rules have not changed overnight, and providing fairness to individuals, whose rights and obligations will not be subject to sudden change,\" Brexit minister David Davis told parliament.Analysis by Thomson Reuters says 52,741 laws have been introduced in the UK as a result of EU legislation since 1990, and research published by parliament estimates 13.2 percent of UK primary and secondary legislation enacted between 1993 and 2004 was EU-related.Davis said the European Court of Justice (ECJ) would have no future role in interpreting British laws, but that courts would be able to reference ECJ case law.The bill is expected to be subject to close scrutiny, with  companies saying they cannot plan without knowing what comes after Brexit, forcing them to put investment programs on hold and sometimes delaying major infrastructure projects.Drugmakers are concerned that Brexit will mean the UK leaves the EU-wide European Medicines Agency, forcing the creation of a separate British system for drug approvals. That will mean more red tape and could delay new medicines reaching Britain.The government's proposals did not specifically address such concerns, which are echoed in other industries such as finance and aviation where firms worry that leaving the EU will mean quitting the regulatory bodies that authorize them to trade.Aides said membership of EU agencies would be a matter for May's negotiation. POWER GRABThe plan also raised hackles among some politicians who fear the government will use the Brexit process to reshape EU laws without proper parliamentary scrutiny as they move them into British law.The Liberal Democrats called it a \"shameless power grab\" and the main opposition Labour Party demanded tighter controls on the powers that the government wants to grant itself to amend legislation without consulting lawmakers.The plan to use such powers, often referred to as 'Henry VIII powers' after the 16th century monarch who ruled by proclamation, also drew wider criticism.Gina Miller, the investment manager who took on the government and won over whether May needed parliament's approval to begin Brexit talks, said she was concerned that laws affecting citizens' rights could be changed.\"If there is any sniff that they are trying to use Henry VIII powers, that would be profoundly unparliamentary and undemocratic, and I would seek legal advice, because what you are doing is setting a precedent that government could bypass parliament,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live.Davis rejected such concerns, saying the bill and the powers it will create were designed to ensure legal certainty and that any changes in policy would be carried out through the normal legislative process, during which parliament would have its say.\"We're not considering some form of governmental executive orders,\" he told parliament.

After examining the victim's passport, Malaysian authorities confused the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the formal name of North Korea, with the Republic of Korea, the official name of its estranged southern neighbor, the sources said.Malaysian authorities contacted the South Korean embassy, sending along copies of documents found on Kim\u2019s body. After the mix-up was realized, North Korea\u2019s diplomatic mission in Kuala Lumpur was informed on the day of the murder, the sources said.Malaysian police did not respond to requests for comment.The confusion over Kim\u2019s nationality also explains why it was the South Korean media that initially broke the news. Within 24 hours of his death, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service had briefed lawmakers in Seoul that Kim Jong Nam was believed dead. It then was leaked to the South Korean media.Hours after the news emerged in South Korea, Malaysian police confirmed that a North Korean man had died at the airport, without disclosing his identity. OUT IN THE OPENSouth Korean and U.S. intelligence sources say North Korea masterminded the attack, which Pyongyang denies.North Korea does not even acknowledge the dead man is Kim Jong Nam. Pyongyang continues to refer to him as Kim Chol, the name on the diplomatic passport Kim was carrying when he died. South Korean intelligence officers say Kim Jong Un had issued standing orders for the elimination of his elder half-brother.Kim Jong Nam\u2019s murder was remarkably public, according to North Korea analysts. The assassins chose an airport covered by CCTV cameras and a designated weapon of mass destruction possessed by only a few states, North Korea among them.\u201cThe effect had to be planned,\u201d said Robert L. Gallucci, a former U.S. chief negotiator with North Korea over its nuclear program. \u201cThey wanted to underline impunity, that they can act with impunity.\u201dThe brazen nature of the assassination also made collecting evidence relatively easy. After the first chaotic day, the investigation was taken over by Malaysia\u2019s Special Branch - which combines the roles of elite police unit and domestic intelligence agency.The two women who smeared the VX nerve agent on Kim - described by police as Vietnamese \u201centertainment outlet employee\u201d Doan Thi Huong and Indonesian \u201cspa masseuse\u201d Siti Aisyah - were arrested three days after the killing. According to lawyers, families and consular officials, the two women believed they were involved in a prank.CCTV AIRPORT FOOTAGEThree days after the women's detention, four North Koreans were named as ringleaders of the plot, all of whom left Malaysia soon after the murder.Captured by CCTV footage at the airport, the men  - later identified by South Korea as agents of Pyongyang\u2019s ministry of state security - were nearby when Kim was poisoned. While South Korea and Malaysia were caught unawares by Kim\u2019s trip to Malaysia, the alleged state security agents at the airport suggests North Korea was well informed.Three of the four arrived in Malaysia before Kim did. The other one landed a day later, on February 7, police have said.Malaysian police believe the women were recruited by another North Korean national, Ri Ji U, also known as James. Two other North Koreans, Hyon Kwang Song, second secretary at the Kuala Lumpur embassy, and Kim Uk Il, a staff member of North Korea\u2019s state airline Air Koryo, were also named as suspects.Ri, Hyon and Kim are believed to be holed up in the North Korean embassy, where Malaysian police are prevented from entering without permission under the Vienna Convention that lays out the international rules of diplomacy.Another \u201cimportant\u201d but unnamed North Korean national is also being sought, Malaysian police inspector-general Khalid Abu Bakar said last week.North Korea and Malaysia's historically close ties began to unravel in the wake of Kim's death, hitting a nadir when Pyongyang banned nine Malaysian citizens from leaving the country in retaliation for the Kim investigation.Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak initially announced a tit-for-tat ban, accusing North Korea of \u201ceffectively holding our citizens hostage\u201d. A day later, he struck a more conciliatory tone, saying the dispute would be solved through quiet negotiations.On Thursday, he said a deal had been struck - Kim Jong Nam's body had been released to North Korea and the nine Malaysians had been allowed to board a plane home.

The person named in filings as the only shareholder of Cambridge Analytica's Australian operation, Allan Lorraine, confirmed in a telephone call he was working with the firm but declined to comment further. Cambridge Analytica's U.S. head office declined an interview request with the company's global chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, to discuss its Australian plans. Nix is scheduled to speak at an Australian data analytics conference next week and will be meeting officials from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal Party. \"Senior Liberals will be talking to Mr Nix and the Cambridge Analytica team while they're out here in Australia, and will be interested to talk with them about their capacities and what they're offering people in the Australian political system,\" said Tony Nutt, party's federal director.The main opposition Labor Party declined to comment.MICROTARGETING VOTERS Cambridge Analytica says it uses \"behavioral microtargeting\", or combining analysis of people's personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two thirds of the population.Its London-based parent company, consumer researcher SCL Group Ltd, says it formed Cambridge Analytica in 2013 to work on the U.S. election. Cambridge Analytica worked for the campaign of failed Republican candidate Ted Cruz before signing on with Trump.Although it has a population of only 24 million, Australia offers high sales volumes for companies which make money from elections. It has federal elections every three years, among the shortest election cycles of developed nations, and is one of the only countries with compulsory voting enforced by fines at federal, state and local government level.The Australian arm of Cambridge Analytica has so far lodged no financial disclosures, according to regulatory records, suggesting it has not traded in the country despite being established before the federal election in 2016 and several state elections.While profiling would-be voters and targeting messaging is nothing new, Cambridge Analytica achieved a degree of notoriety after media reports revealed the extent of its data gathering and apparent effectiveness.\"It is scary how accurate the information is you can glean from publicly available data,\" said Bela Stantic, an information technology professor who runs the Big Data and Smart Analytics laboratory at Griffith University in Australia.DIFFERENT MARKETStill, Australian election analysts questioned whether Cambridge Analytica's model, which involves analyzing people's voting and party registration history, as well as social media profiles and other data, would work in Australia. Most Australians do not register for political parties and voting histories are not recorded, while the country's compulsory voting system also weakens the power of campaigns aimed at encouraging - or discouraging - certain demographic groups to vote.\"They might find it useful but still most political professionals in this country would be of the view that campaigns are not about motivating people to vote, it's about banging the same message long enough that those who aren't interested hear it,\" said Antony Green, election analyst at the Australian Broadcasting Corp.Alex Oliver, director of the polling program at non-partisan think tank the Lowy Institute, said Australian law required organizations to disclose the source of political advertising.\"I'd be concerned about the intentions and bona fides of a commercial organization which claimed to have influenced important elections through audience targeting and psychological manipulation,\" Oliver said in an email.\"That practice, if indeed it could be achieved, would impinge on the proper functioning of a democratic system.\" (Editing by Lincoln Feast)"},

Ananthalakshmi", "Timestamp": "Thu Mar 30, 2017 | 5:07am EDT", "Content": "KUALA LUMPUR More than one hundred foreigners died in the past two years in Malaysia's immigration detention centers from various diseases and unknown causes, according to documents from the government\u2013funded National Human Rights Commission reviewed by Reuters.The toll, which has not been previously disclosed, is based on Malaysian immigration department data provided to the commission, which is known by its Malay acronym Suhakam. There were 83 deaths in 2015, and at least 35 in 2016 up to Dec. 20.It is unclear whether the death rate is higher than in neighboring countries. Government officials in Indonesia and Thailand told Reuters they do not disclose such numbers. The rate is higher than in major industrialized nations such as the United States, which in the last financial year recorded 10 deaths in its immigration detention system, which has many more detainees than Malaysia\u2019s.More than half of the 118 dead are from Myanmar, the source for tens of thousands of refugees coming to Malaysia, including Rohingya Muslims escaping persecution by Myanmar\u2019s authorities and its majority Buddhist population. The number of Rohingya fatalities in the camps is unknown.For a graphic on deaths in detention in Malaysia, click here Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been a harsh critic of the Myanmar government and its de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi after a crackdown in October by Myanmar\u2019s security forces led many Rohingya to flee across its borders amid multiple allegations of mass killings and gang rapes by troops. He has called for foreign intervention to stop the \u201cgenocide\u201d in Myanmar.Najib\u2019s office did not return calls seeking comment.\"The numbers are too many and are shocking and it calls for the overhaul of the system,\" said Jerald Joseph, one of eight commissioners at Suhakam, which was established by the Malaysian parliament through an act in 1999 and is due to publicly announce the numbers next week in its annual report on human rights issues in Malaysia.He described conditions at the centers, some of which he has visited, as \u201cappalling\u201d and said the deaths should be investigated as a criminal matter. \u00a0The illnesses that led to some of the deaths may have been caused or exacerbated by poor sanitation and food, physical abuse and a lack of medical attention, said Joseph, who was speaking on behalf of the commission.BRUTAL CONDITIONSMalaysia\u2019s home ministry, which oversees the immigration department, said it was trying to improve the conditions in the centers but that its budget was constrained.\u201cI agree there is some overcrowding and the conditions are not ideal. We are always trying to improve the procedures, health conditions and management of these sites. The problem is we hit a budget brick wall,\" said deputy home minister Nur\u00a0Jazlan\u00a0Mohamed in an interview.He said there wasn't enough funding to upgrade facilities, provide adequate healthcare and hire and train enforcement officers. Jazlan blamed overcrowding on the \u201cnever ending flow of people seeking better future in Malaysia.\u201dThe living conditions inside the Malaysian camps are grim \u2013 overcrowded, unhygienic and brutal - according to interviews with 13 former detainees, and 12 others who have regularly visited the centers, including people from government agencies and rights groups.Those who had been detained say they did not get adequate food, water or healthcare, that many inmates developed skin and lung infections, and the sick are usually not isolated, leading to the spread of contagious diseases.All of the detainees interviewed also allege they were beaten by guards at the camps or witnessed others being beaten. One former Rohingya inmate of the Lenggeng camp in the southwestern state of Negeri Sembilan told Reuters in an interview that he witnessed detainees being beaten and then saw them die when the resulting injuries were not treated. \u201cWhen we asked for medicines, we were beaten,\u201d he said.Reuters could not independently verify his account or the similar accusations made by other detainees. They all declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.Asked about the claims of beatings, Jazlan said he needs more evidence to establish if it was prevalent. \u00a0\"I hope critics won't rely on detainees' testimony, and come up with proper evidence,\" he said.FARED WORSEOf the 118 people recorded as dying in 2015-2016, 63 were from Myanmar, and people from that country have fared worse than those from elsewhere, the documents from Suhakam and data from the Malaysian government\u2019s Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission (EAIC) show.During 2016, for example, there were 14,180 Myanmar nationals detained and at least 14 of them died, while there were only five fatalities among 34,586 Indonesian inmates. The documents and data don\u2019t explain this discrepancy and Reuters was unable to independently confirm the reason for it.People from Myanmar, including Rohingya Muslims, tend to stay in the detention centers longer as they try to persuade the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to issue them with identification cards that allow them to stay in Malaysia temporarily, rights groups and former detainees said. People from other countries are often undocumented migrant workers who are deported home relatively quickly.Malaysia, which has not signed the U.N. Refugee Convention, treats refugees as illegal migrants with few rights.Asked about the deaths of Myanmar nationals in Malaysian detention centers, Zaw Htay, who is spokesman for Myamnar's Suu Kyi, said that \u201cwe haven\u2019t heard about these cases.\u201d He also said that \u201ca lot of Bengali people in Malaysia say they come from Myanmar to get UNHCR cards.\u201d\u201cBengali\u201d is a\u00a0derogatory term used by many in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya that suggests they come from Bangladesh, even though many Rohingya have lived in the country for generations.LUNG INFECTIONSThe documents reviewed by Reuters give causes of death for 68 detainees. Pneumonia and lung infections led to 19 deaths, at least 10 were the result of various heart-related conditions, and five died from the bacterial disease leptospirosis,\u00a0which is often spread through the urine of infected animals, including rodents.Sepsis, or septic shock, a condition usually triggered by other illnesses, claimed 21 victims, including some who were suffering from pneumonia or leptospirosis, various forms of tuberculosis led to three deaths, and one Filipino woman committed suicide.The 13 detention centers in Malaysia held a total 86,795 detainees for various periods during 2016, according to the EAIC.Malaysia isn\u2019t the only country in southeast Asia that has faced criticism for the conditions in its prisons. In its human rights report for 2016, the U.S. State Department said Indonesian and Thai facilities, including those used to detain immigrants, are overcrowded. It said government figures showed that 548 prisoners died \u201cin custody\u201d in Indonesia between January and June of 2016, and 762 died in \u201cofficial custody\u201d in Thailand in the year to September 2016. However, there was no breakdown between those who died in ordinary jails and those who died in other forms of incarceration, such as immigration detention facilities.\u00a0No cause was given for 50 deaths in Malaysia. They are classified in the documents as \"no report\" or \"pending autopsy\" or \"undetermined\" or \"awaiting report from hospital\" or \"unascertained.\" One center in Kuala Lumpur had 13 deaths in 2016, but no reasons were stated for any of them.When asked about the lack of reasons given for so many deaths, Jazlan said he will look into it.The documents do not specify the reasons for the lower death rate in 2016, though a Reuters analysis of them and related data shows that there was a 27 percent drop in the number of people detained at the end of 2016 from a year earlier.

He called the investment a \"huge mistake.\" \"My approach to mistakes is that I personally assume 100 percent of the responsibility on behalf of the firm,\" he wrote in the firm's annual letter released to clients on Tuesday evening and seen by Reuters on Wednesday.The 50-year-old manager acknowledged the toll the bad bet  has taken on his image and said he misjudged the management team in place when he bought the stock.\"We deeply regret this mistake, which has cost all of us a tremendous amount,\" he wrote.Thanks largely to Valeant's tumble, Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management suffered back-to-back losses in 2015 and 2016 as his reputation as one of the hedge fund industry's most talented investors dimmed.Since launching the firm in 2004, Ackman has delivered a compound annual net return of 14.8 percent. He tends to take concentrated bets and often pushes management to perform better by urging spin-offs or other measures.Nonetheless the board of Pershing Square Holdings, Ackman's publicly traded investment vehicle, decided after a review of his performance that he should continue to manage the investments, Anne Farlow, the chair, wrote in a separate letter.She welcomed Ackman's openness in analyzing what led to the Valeant failure.In his letter, Ackman laid some blame at the feet of Valeant's former management team, which he had thought was building the next Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), once of the most profitable companies in the country.Ackman met former Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson in 2014, when Pearson enlisted Ackman's help to try and buy Allergan and Pershing Square bought up Allergan shares to try and push that company's management into selling to Valeant.Allergan ended up selling to a Actavis, netting Ackman his best-ever returns with his Pershing Square LP fund gaining 36.9 percent in 2014.Ackman fired Pearson in 2016, however, after he got a seat on Valeant's board.\"Prior management substantially overpaid for the company's largest acquisition - its acquisition of Salix - which occurred contemporaneously with the substantial majority of our investment in the company,\" Ackman wrote.Pershing Square Holdings has swung to losses of 2.5 percent after starting the year with gains, but Ackman promised a quick recovery in the letter to clients.

The regulated company will also have its own board.IRISH CRY FOULAn initial shortlist of locations had been whittled down to two -- Brussels and Luxembourg -- with the insurance market's council making the final decision on Wednesday.U.S. insurer AIG said this month it was setting up an EU hub in Luxembourg, and Lloyd's insurer Hiscox is choosing between Luxembourg and Malta. Brussels was attractive because of its talented workforce and place at the heart of the EU, Nelson said. Lloyd's gets around 11 percent of its business from Europe excluding Britain.\"The next question is how many of the other UK-domiciled insurers and reinsurers will follow,\" said Sarj Panesar, global head of business development for insurance at Societe Generale Securities Services. \"We can expect some to join Lloyd's in Brussels.\"The subsidiary will be able to reinsure its business back to London, on similar lines to other Lloyd's hubs such as China, Nelson said, a model which insurance sources said made Brussels' pitch attractive.Dublin, initially seen as a favorite for Lloyd's and other insurers' EU subsidiaries, has complained to the European Commission that it is being undercut by rival centers.Trade body Insurance Ireland this week called on its government for a review to help Ireland \"convert expressions of interest into investment decisions\". Royal London said on Thursday it was converting its Irish business into a regulated subsidiary.Lloyd's EU subsidiary aims to be ready to write insurance business in time for the Jan 1, 2019 renewal season, it said in a statement. Also on Thursday, Lloyd's of London reported pre-tax profit of 2.1 billion pounds for 2016, steady from 2015.But underwriting profit dropped sharply to 500 million pounds from 2 billion, due to strong competition and large losses from natural catastrophes.

You have no clue what's going on,\" shouted another.Toshiba, which expects to book an annual net loss of 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) for this business year on a writedown at Westinghouse, has said it is selling most or even all of a unit that is the world's second-biggest producer of NAND chips.Initial bids for the sale closed on Wednesday.A source with knowledge of the planned sale said that about 10 potential bidders are interested. Those suitors include Western Digital Corp which operates a chip plant with Toshiba in Japan, Micron Technology Inc, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc and financial investors.The government-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, and Development Bank of Japan are expected to enter later bidding rounds as part of a consortium, sources have said, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak on the matter publicly.A separate source said that Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, is expected to place an offer which is likely to be the highest bid. Other sources have said the Japanese government is likely to block a sale to Foxconn due to its deep ties with China.While the vote, which won the backing of more than two-thirds of shareholders, and the bankruptcy filing by Westinghouse are steps forward in Toshiba's struggle to stay in business, it woes are far from over.Toshiba, which bought Westinghouse in 2006 for $5.4 billion now faces months of complex negotiations over the fate of its U.S. nuclear business, a discussion that could embroil the U.S. and Japanese governments.The U.S. government has guaranteed loans of $8.3 billion loan to help finance some the construction of four reactors in the United States.Putting American taxpayers on the hook for any losses related to Westinghouse's failure would be an embarrassment for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, particularly if the debacle sparks criticism from President Donald Trump of Japanese corporations in the United States.During talks in Washington this month Japan's Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko agreed to share information on developments with his U.S. counterparts Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.Senior officials from both countries will get a chance to discuss Toshiba further in April when Vice President Mike Pence visit for bilateral economic talks. Ross will travel with Pence, according to a Japanese government official with direct knowledge of preparations.  (Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Writing by Tim Kelly; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)"},

The incident cost Samsung $5.5 billion in profit and dealt a heavy blow to its reputation. Two versions of the Galaxy S8, code-named Dream internally, were launched at a media event in New York on Wednesday, with 6.2-inch (15.75 cm) and 5.8-inch curved screens. They will go on sale on April 21 in three markets - Canada, South Korea and the United States - and roll out to other markets in the following weeks.\"We must be bold enough to step into the unknown and humble enough to learn from our mistakes,\" Koh Dong-jin, the company's mobile chief, said at the event after acknowledging that it had been a challenging year for Samsung.Koh expects the S8 to outsell the 2016 predecessor Galaxy S7, which Samsung said last week set the firm's internal record for first-year sales, despite the fact S8 sales will begin more than a month later than the S7's last year. Researcher Counterpoint says Samsung could sell as many as 53 million S8s this year, which it says compares with fewer than 50 million S7s sold in 2016. U.S. carriers T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) announced retail pricing for the smaller S8 around $700. The larger phone will sell for $840 at Verizon and $850 at T-Mobile.The S8 features Samsung's new artificial intelligence service, Bixby, with functions including a voice-commanded assistant system similar to Apple's Siri. There is also a new facial recognition application that lets users unlock their phones by looking at them.Samsung hopes the design update and the new features, focused on making life easier for consumers, will be enough to revive sales in a year Apple is expected to introduce major changes to its iPhones, including the very curved screens that have become staples of the Galaxy brand.The S8 is also crucial for Samsung's image as a maker of reliable mobile devices. Analysts say Samsung must prove it can avoid a repeat of the Note 7 crisis.\"The Galaxy S8 is the most important phone for Samsung in a decade and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,\" said Ben Wood, a smartphone industry analyst with UK-based CCS Insight.

Johnson, the newly-ascended world number one, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy are the three clear favorites for the year\u2019s first major championship, though at least two dozen others have a realistic chance of winning if the stars all align at the right time.But the road to the Green Jacket will lead through Johnson, who ticks all the boxes as the man to beat. Before he is measured for a Green Jacket, however, it would be wise to remember he would not be the first favorite to be spat out by the unforgiving Augusta National layout.The American, with victories in his past three starts, has a game tailor made for Augusta, prodigiously long off the tee, confident with his irons and short game and a soft putting stroke that seems to be getting better with age.He also has a good recent Masters record \u2013 tied fourth last year and tied sixth in 2015 \u2013 and returns approaching a golfer\u2019s usual peak at the age of 32.\u201cI don't think I've ever gone into a major being ranked number one,\u201d he said recently, before adding to laughter: \u201cActually, I know I haven't.\"It\u2019s not going to be any different for me. I'm still going to prepare like I always do and go out and try to play the best I can. I played good there the last two years. I'm excited to go back when the game is in good form. I feel like everything is working pretty well.\u201dWhile Johnson arrives with a spring in his step, Spieth is hardly looking forward to being reminded of his 2016 debacle, when he endured arguably the worst collapse in Masters history, giving up a five-shot lead over the final nine holes, due largely to a quadruple bogey at the 12th hole.He missed the cut in Houston on Friday, but publicly at least sounded an upbeat note.\u201cI made strides in my putting this week, which is something I can take a lot of confidence into next week,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting well next week obviously is important considering I didn't strike it very well last year and certainly was in position to win.\u201dMCILROY SHARPWhile Spieth\u2019s short game and putting are usually second to none, McIlroy has been working to raise those facets of the game to a level close to his ball-striking.Perhaps only Johnson can drive the ball as long and accurately as McIlroy, whose chances often hinge on the quality of his wedge game and putter.\u201cI feel like that part of my game is as sharp as it has ever been going into Augusta, so that's a good thing,\u201d said McIlroy, who with a victory would become just the sixth man to win all four modern major championships.Others to watch include American veteran Phil Mickelson as he goes for a fourth Green Jacket at the age of 46, Hideki Matsuyama trying to fulfill the hopes of a nation and become the first Japanese player to win a men\u2019s major, and Jon Rahm, young, strong and fearless, whose chances maybe be hindered only by his lack of course knowledge in his Masters debut.Fellow Spaniard Sergio Garcia has the quality to end his majors drought if he can turn back the clock and putt as well as before several near-misses started to weigh him down.For those searching for a realistic dark horse, keep an eye on Australian Marc Leishman, winner of the recent Arnold Palmer Invitational.Another outstanding ball-striker, Leishman tied for fourth in 2013, when he played the final round with eventual winner Adam Scott.

More investors would buy the shares, helping boost the company's market capitalization, Greenlight contended.But 53 out of 61 investors surveyed by investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI said they did not believe Greenlight's proposal would lead to value accretion at GM. In fact, a significant majority of investors polled - 48 people, or 80 percent - said Einhorn's plan could jeopardize the company's credit rating. Of the investors surveyed, 34 percent were GM shareholders.Greenlight on Friday called the survey \"fundamentally flawed\" and through a spokesman said it failed to understand the firm's plan to unlock value at GM. GM rejected Einhorn's plan, saying it had reviewed it for seven months but considered it too risky.Evercore ISI surveyed investors after Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and has a 4.9 percent stake in GM, including options, released his presentation in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.Now Einhorn is taking his plan to GM shareholders more broadly through a proxy contest where he hopes to win seats on the board. Investors will vote on board members at the upcoming annual meeting and Einhorn would need to quickly mobilize many large owners to agree with his proposal in order to win enough votes for his slate.While a number of investors in Einhorn's own fund have applauded him for coming up with this novel approach, no major GM shareholder has yet publicly thrown their weight behind the plan.

Failla also denied Wells Fargo's bid to dismiss claims by Germany's Commerzbank AG (CBKG.DE).Ancel Martinez, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to comment. A lawyer for many of the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Failla's 80-page decision covers five lawsuits, which comprise one of the largest remaining pieces of U.S. litigation seeking to hold banks liable for risky mortgage securities that were a major cause of the 2008 global financial crisis.Much of this litigation targeted lenders, but some targeted trustees that oversaw the securities' performance.Investors accused Wells Fargo of having taken \"virtually no action\" to require lenders to buy back or fix defaulted or poorly underwritten loans that backed their securities, despite knowing of shortfalls.They said the San Francisco-based bank's resistance stemmed from concern that acting would have exposed its own \"misconduct\" in other residential mortgage-backed securities trusts, and jeopardized its business dealings with lenders and servicers, court papers show.Failla said the plaintiffs \"more than met\" the legal standard for letting the breach of contract claims proceed, having pointed to internal Wells Fargo documents to suggest the bank knew about many loan defects but did nothing.\"It is plaintiffs' contention that such allegations go far beyond many other RMBS trustee complaints, which themselves have been found sufficient to state a claim,\" Failla wrote, without ruling on the merits. \"The court agrees.\"Failla also said the National Credit Union Administration may pursue various claims against Wells Fargo on behalf of five failed credit unions.The NCUA has already recouped roughly $4.3 billion in litigation against many banks over securities that the credit unions bought.

One of the sources has direct knowledge of the delay and the other was briefed on the matter.Toshiba also may not be able to decide the favored bidder or group for its semiconductor business by its general shareholder meeting in late June, said another person with direct knowledge of the matter. He had previously said the decision would be made in May, or at least before the shareholder meeting. Toshiba and PwC officials could not be reached for comment in Tokyo outside business hours.The Japanese conglomerate, which only recently emerged from a huge accounting scandal, has been dragged down by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its former U.S. nuclear unit, Westinghouse Electric Co.      Disagreements with auditors forced the company to\u00a0postpone its earnings release in February and again in March. After April 11, Toshiba will have eight working days to publish its results for the three months that ended Dec. 31 unless it can persuade regulators at the Ministry of Finance to give it more time.Despite some progress in tackling writedowns at Westinghouse, a new delay to the Japanese parent's earnings announcement would underscore the seriousness of the financial crisis that threatens the 144-year old company. For the business year ended Friday, Toshiba forecasts a net loss of 1 trillion yen ($9 billion).Westinghouse on Wednesday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors in New York, a move by Toshiba to fence off losses at the unit it bought in 2006 for $5.4 billion. The filing marks the start of what will likely be lengthy and complex negotiations with creditors and customers that could embroil the U.S. and Japanese governments.Toshiba's shareholders at an extraordinary meeting in Japan on Thursday agreed to split off the company's profitable NAND flash memory unit, green-lighting a plan to sell most or all of the business to raise at least 1 trillion yen to cover charges at Westinghouse.

The militants captured and beheaded their father, a Shi'ite militiaman, in 2014; before that, the family lost another son fighting the jihadists.\"We were able to identify my dad's body by the tattoo on his arm. The head wasn't found. They had also drilled holes in his hands and cut fingers off,\" 31-year-old Jassem told Reuters on the front line in Mosul as Iraqi forces battle with Islamic State in the city.After the murder, Jassem's youngest brother signed up with the army and another joined a Shi'ite paramilitary group. With a further brother already with the Counter-Terrorism Service, that meant their mother had all four of her surviving sons at war.\"Mum wasn't happy,\" said Jassem, not giving his full name because he works in intelligence. But his brothers still answered the call to arms. \"They said Iraq was falling apart, and they wanted to protect it,\" he said.The family from southern Iraq - far from Mosul which lies near the country's northern border - is just one of many where entire sets of brothers have taken up arms against Islamic State out of revenge, duty or just to earn money.The U.S.-backed Iraqi forces are now set to drive the group from its stronghold of Mosul, taken in 2014 when the jihadists seized large areas of Iraq and Syria, proclaiming a caliphate. (Full Story)But the fight has further militarised Iraqi society, pushing young men into the armed forces and, increasingly, sectarian and tribal militias. This has raised fears of new outbreaks of violence once the caliphate has crumbled.Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric issued a fatwa in 2014, calling on all men able to carry arms to fight Islamic State, which is known in Arabic by its opponents as Daesh.On another Mosul front line, Counter-Terrorism Service commando Hamza Kadhem said that before Islamic State arrived, he was the only one of five brothers to have picked up a gun. \"The others all joined after the fatwa,\" he said.They joined the Hashid Shaabi, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, a state-run umbrella that includes Shi'ite militias. Two are deployed west of Mosul, and another two near the Syrian border, where Shi'ite fighters have played a crucial role in cutting off Islamic State supply lines.Before the call-up, they had worked as farmers in the southern Kut region, more than 500 km (300 miles) away.As well as Shi'ites from the south, young men from around Mosul - where Sunni Muslims are in the majority - are also keen to fight.They are now flooding to join Sunni tribal militias also under the Hashid, security officials and militia leaders say. Many residents told Reuters in recent weeks they want to join, or know relatives and friends who are trying to do so.\"Many men are volunteering in the Hashid groups. They either want to fight terrorism or to get wages,\" one security officer in the area said, declining to be named because he was not authorised to speak publicly. \"It's easier than joining state armed forces. You just put your name down.\"He said the number of those seeking to join could be in the thousands, on top of the several thousand that local community leaders estimate are already in the Sunni tribal militias.This would not pose security problems because the Hashid ultimately answer to the government and have limited powers, the officer added.MILITIAS SPREADProvincial government officials, however, say the rising number of recruits to paramilitary forces and the formation of new militias is dangerous because it raises the risk of factional clashes.\"These Hashid groups are subservient to the people who lead them, not to the state,\" said Abdul Rahman al-Wagga, a council member for Nineveh, of which Mosul is the capital.\"So if a Hashid leader wants to impose himself in a certain region, and another sheikh or clan doesn't like it, they might attack,\" he told Reuters by phone. \"I think after Daesh, these groups will not be reined in ... Their agendas are party, political or regional, and won't serve Nineveh, or Iraq.\"Ramzy Mardini, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said turning to armed forces, particularly militias, was inevitable in an atmosphere where local communities fear for their own safety.\"Not only has the war further militarised Iraqi society, but there appears to be no pressure from the top or willingness from below to disarm, demobilise, and reintegrate the militias that now occupy the diverse and former insurgent landscape,\" he said.As Iraqi government forces have moved deeper into Mosul city, the areas around it have increasingly come under the control of the expanding Hashid, who fly their flags at checkpoints and have set up offices in nearby towns.Hashid officials say they are there to ensure Islamic State does not return, and that their local knowledge can make them more effective than federal police.\"Iraq's security is our responsibility,\" read a slogan painted on a building outside Mosul that is occupied by the new office of a Hashid group, and was formerly used by an Islamic State fighter and his family.Most ordinary Iraqis, like the families of Jassem and Kadhem, do not want their sons to have to fight. But the young men see little choice after suffering at the hands of militants, and with few other ways to earn a living.Former policeman Yassin Saleh, 47, sat in his wheelchair on a roadside outside Mosul last month after fleeing violence. \"Two of my boys, who are 20 and 21, want to volunteer for the Hashid,\" he said. \"But I need them around to help me.\"Saleh lost both his legs to a car bomb planted by al Qaeda militants in 2008. Two months later, the fighters kidnapped and killed his eldest son.\"There will always be revenge. If people have killed someone's dad or brother, they won't just let it go,\" he said. \"But I can't lose another son.\"(editing by David Stamp)"},

We think we'll find more,\" Villagarzon Mayor Jhon Ever Calderon told Reuters. He said the town had no coffins or sanitary storage.Many families in Mocoa stayed up through the night to search through the debris, despite the lack of electricity in the city.\"I need to know where they are, if they are injured or where to find them,\" sobbed Maria Lilia Tisoy, 37, looking through the rubble for her two daughters, one pregnant, and a 4-year-old granddaughter.\"If they are dead, please God deliver them to me,\" she said.President Juan Manuel Santos made a second visit to the area on Sunday. He said water and energy services would be restored as soon as possible.Santos blamed climate change for the disaster, saying Mocoa had received one-third of its usual monthly rain in just one night, causing the rivers to burst their banks.There was disagreement over the death toll for most of Sunday but, late in the evening, the government's total was increased to match the 254-person figure released by the army. Just over 200 were injured. Disaster officials said more than 500 people were staying in emergency housing and social services had helped 10 lost children find their parents.The disaster came after deadly flooding in Peru killed more than 100 people and destroyed infrastructure.Families of the dead will receive about $6,400 in aid and the government will cover hospital and funeral costs.Even in a country where heavy rains, a mountainous landscape and informal construction combine to make landslides a common occurrence, the scale of the Mocoa disaster was daunting compared to recent tragedies, including a 2015 landslide that killed nearly 100 people. Colombia's deadliest landslide, the 1985 Armero disaster, killed more than 20,000 people.    Santos urged Colombians to take precautions against flooding and continued rains. The president also thanked China and the Inter-American Development Bank for donating $1 million and $200,000 respectively toward relief efforts.

Piech's total stake in Porsche SE is worth about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) at current market prices.The withdrawal from Porsche SE of Piech, who turns 80 on April 17, had been expected after the company said last month he was in talks about selling his holding.It marks an end to the influence of one of the last towering figures in the auto industry, who has had a rocky relationship with VW since he was ousted as chairman in 2015, months before the company was engulfed in an emissions test cheating scandal.An industrial scion and engineer, Piech transformed VW from a regional carmaker into a global powerhouse which during his reign bought the luxury Bugatti, Bentley and Lamborghini brands and integrated the mass-market Skoda and Seat businesses.The grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, founder of the sports car maker that developed the classic VW Beetle under a 1934 contract with the Nazis, Piech led VW as chief executive from 1993, and later as chairman. But since quitting as chairman in April 2015 following a power struggle with former CEO Martin Winterkorn, he has become a recluse and unwilling to defend the empire he helped build.In that struggle, Piech's billionaire cousin Wolfgang Porsche, the chairman of Porsche SE, sided with Winterkorn, as did other top players on VW's supervisory board. A media report in February said Piech had told investigators that his cousin and other VW board members knew about the emissions test cheating earlier than stated in public - something VW has denied. That led some members of the Porsche and Piech clans to want to eject Piech from the supervisory board of Porsche SE, a source at the holding company has said. Porsche SE said on Monday Piech would stay on the board until the closing of the stake sale, which requires regulatory approval. Piech's Ferdinand Karl Beta foundation will retain a minor stake in Porsche SE, it added, without elaborating.  (Editing by Victoria Bryan and Mark Potter)"},

The reports pointed to strong fundamentals despite signs of weak economic growth in the first quarter.\"The U.S. economic expansion remains on solid footing even taking into a account what is likely to be a pretty lackluster first-quarter growth profile,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S.economist at RBC Markets in New York.The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 57.2 last month from 57.7 in February, which was the highest since August 2014.A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.Seventeen of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth and no industry reported a contraction. Comments from factories were mostly upbeat, with machinery manufacturers saying that business was up 10 percent to 15 percent. Transport equipment manufacturers, however, described the industry's outlook as \"relatively flat.\" The manufacturing recovery is being driven by the energy sector as steady increases in crude oil prices boost drilling activity.A report from energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday showed U.S. drillers added 137 rigs in the first quarter, the most since the second quarter of 2011. That has fueled demand for machinery, resulting in business spending on equipment rising in the fourth quarter for the first time in a year.Manufacturing is also benefiting from a surge in business sentiment following President Donald Trump's pledge to pursue business-friendly policies, including cutting corporate taxes and deregulation.But after last month's failed attempt by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives to repeal the Obama administration's 2010 healthcare law, economists warn that Trump might struggle to implement his agenda.The dollar rose to a two-week high against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell after New York and other states challenged the Trump administration on grounds of illegally blocking energy efficiency standards. U.S. Treasuries rose.HIRING PROSPECTS BRIGHTEN\tLast month, the ISM survey's production sub-index decreased 5.3 percentage points to 57.6. A gauge of manufacturing inventories contracted. While that weighed on the ISM index, it bodes well for future manufacturing activity.Though a measure of new orders fell last month, it remained near a more than three-year high. A gauge of factory employment jumped to its highest reading since June 2011. That would suggest another strong month of factory job gains in March.But sentiment indicators such as the ISM have been painting a more robust picture than the so-called hard data, which has suggested that the economy grew around a 1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter.\"If manufacturers hire as many workers as the survey says they are planning to do, the nonfarm payroll jobs number on Friday could be a blowout,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.Manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, further evidence that inflation pressures are building up. A report on Friday showed a key consumer inflation measure in February recorded its biggest annual gain in nearly five years.The ISM's prices index rose 2.5 percentage points in February to 70.5, the highest reading since May 2011, indicating higher raw materials prices for the 13th straight month.A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending increased 0.8 percent to $1.19 trillion in February, the highest level since April 2006, after  dropping 0.4 percent in January.  Construction spending was boosted by outlays on private residential construction, which surged 1.8 percent to the highest level since July 2007. Spending on private nonresidential structures fell 0.3 percent.\"The trend in nonresidential construction spending has softened lately,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"Despite this weakening in the data, we still look for a strong increase in overall private nonresidential investment in the first quarter because of large gains in separate data related to activity in the energy sector.\"  (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"},

The group had called the requirement under then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler \"stunningly bad and inexplicable government policy.\"The group warned it would have \"devastating effects on the smaller broadband providers Charter will overbuild\" because they would face competition from an \"uneconomic, government mandated entry\" that could put some companies out of business.Gigi Sohn, a former top Wheeler aide, said the decision shows the Republican FCC is more focused on putting \"incumbents first\" than on competition.

But the two men differ in almost every other respect, from their political styles to their diplomatic experience, adding uncertainty to what has been called the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship.Five months after his election on a stridently anti-China platform, Trump appears to have set himself on a course for collision rather than conciliation with Xi, raising doubts as to whether the world's two biggest economies can find common ground.Topping the agenda at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida will be whether he will make good on his threat to use crucial U.S.-China trade ties to pressure Beijing to do more to rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea, which is working to develop\u00a0missiles capable of hitting the United States.Trump, a 70-year-old former real estate magnate with no foreign policy experience before entering the White House, has tweeted that it will be a \"very difficult\u201d meeting with the veteran Communist Party leader seven years his junior, given Chinese trade practices he says are killing U.S. jobs.He has also demanded that Beijing do more to \u201csolve\u201d the North Korean problem \u2013 his biggest national security challenge - or he will act alone to deal with Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.Some White House aides believe Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner could be an influential moderating voice on how he handles Xi in their talks on Thursday and Friday. Contacts between Kushner and China\u2019s U.S. envoy helped smooth the way for the meeting, according to current and former U.S. officials.Even so, what worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president.\"Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China,\u201d a Chinese official said.U.S. presidents\u2019 meetings with their Chinese counterparts are usually more tightly scripted than with other foreign leaders, something Chinese officials insist on to make sure they are treated with the decorum they believe befits a global power.This summit should offer a study in contrasts: Trump impatient, outspoken and prone to angry tweet-storms; Xi, outwardly calm and measured, with no known social media presence.Their shared nationalist tendencies could aggravate  friction between their countries, which are increasingly global rivals.Trump insists the United States has been cheated economically for decades by countries like China and must regain its luster, while Xi wants China, once an ancient empire, to be able to flex its muscles on the world stage.\u201cXi and Trump are not natural friends,\u201d said a former senior U.S. official specializing in Asia. \"The question is when Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hits Xi\u2019s \u2018Chinese Dream\u2019, what\u2019s the result?\u201dWON\u2019T PULL PUNCHESIt remains unclear how far Trump will go in translating populist rhetoric into policy that steps up pressure on China, given the risk of a trade war neither country can afford.But aides say he won't pull his punches, especially on trade, on which he has held an outspoken view for decades.This adds to doubts as to whether the two leaders can find  common ground on North Korea and China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.Some analysts question whether Trump can get the better of Xi, who was born into a life of politics and has a reputation for being a tough tactician.\"Xi\u2019s performed pretty well in these types of environments,\" said Christopher Johnson, a China expert and former CIA analyst at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.While Trump has been in office little more than 10 weeks, Xi has honed his U.S. strategy since assuming the Chinese leadership\u00a0in 2013.The son of a revolutionary leader, Xi has sought to project the image internationally of a strong advocate of globalization at a time when Trump has stoked fears of\u00a0U.S. protectionism.Still, Chinese officials are mindful of the pitfalls if Trump veers off-script.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe found himself in a long, uncomfortable handshake at the White House in February, and Trump appeared to ignore German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s offer of a handshake during their meeting last month.An acrimonious call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull caused particular concern in Beijing, officials there say. Still, the decision to hold a summit so early in Trump\u2019s presidency suggests both Washington and Beijing see the value of trying to build a personal relationship between the two leaders.Trump goes into the meeting with significant gaps in his\u00a0team of Asia advisers and his China policy still not fully formulated.Hardliners like trade adviser Peter Navarro, who authored a book \u201cDeath by China,\u201d have feuded over the administration's approach to China with more pragmatic aides such as economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president, current and former U.S. officials say.Administration officials argue Trump can use his \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d sales techniques to convince Xi that China needs the United States more than the United States needs China, especially when it comes to market access.But analysts say the Chinese are shrewd enough at geopolitics to fend off U.S. demands. Xi may also see Trump politically weakened by his high-profile legislative failure on healthcare as well as his low public approval ratings.Trump has already backed down on China's most sensitive issue - Taiwan - having first infuriated Beijing by suggesting he might not abide by Washington\u2019s long-standing \u201cone China\u201d policy. Trump may now feel he is owed a favor in return.A fence-mending phone call in February was arranged by Kushner and China\u2019s U.S. ambassador, Cui Tiankai, officials say, after Cui invited Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka to the Chinese Embassy's Lunar New Year reception, where her daughter sang in Mandarin.Both sides are keeping expectations low for tangible outcomes from the summit, billed as informal \"get to know you\" meetings similar to the 2013 Sunnylands summit in California between Xi and Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama.And whatever else, unlike Abe's February visit to Mar-a-Lago, there will be no golf diplomacy: China\u2019s Communist Party associates golf with shady dealings and has sought to stop officials from playing it as part of Xi's fight against corruption.

No reasons have been given and no announcements have been made in official media.About 700 km (430 miles) to the south, near the city of Dandong, the New Yalu River Bridge connecting the two countries lies unfinished. It was planned in 2010 at a cost of 2.2 billion yuan, but stands now as a monument to the slowdown in economic ties. (Map - China-North Korea border region tmsnrt.rs/2nCRNSX) A Reuters team visiting the area saw some signs of trade - trucks coming across another bridge over the Yalu and boats being loaded with goods on the North Korean side of the river.Beijing appears sensitive about the North Korea issue - a Reuters journalist who visited the Northeast Asia Special Region near China's city of Helong last week was escorted out by police.\"Right now tensions are so high between China and North Korea that even this economic zone is a sensitive topic,\" local official Wang Fusheng said.The Helong local government declined further comment.China's relations with North Korea are expected to be high on the agenda when Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump hold their first summit meeting this week. Washington wants China to do more to rein in the unpredictable North's nuclear and missile programs, while Beijing has said it does not have that kind of influence.Trump raised the pressure on Sunday, holding out the possibility of using trade as a lever to secure Chinese cooperation.China has taken steps to increase economic pressure on Pyongyang but has long been unwilling to do anything that may destabilize the North and send millions of refugees across their border.The slowdown in the economic relationship between the two countries became marked after North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016 and a series of missile launches since then.GLOBAL TRADE HUBThe development plan for the Northeast Asia Special Region was to link Helong with North Korea's Maofeng International Tourism Zone and its port city of Chongjin in an area that would feature golf courses, blueberry fields, horse riding, logistics hubs and trade in everything from timber to textiles.The region is intended to connect China and North Korea via air, road and freight train routes, according to information on billboards in China's Nanping village, where North Korea is just across the winding Tumen River. The ultimate aim is to export products from both countries through Chongjin to Japan, South Korea, the United States and Europe - an aspiration thwarted by tightening global sanctions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.According to the plan, Nanping village itself is to be demolished and turned into the Helong Frontier Economic Cooperation Zone - a key part of the Northeast Asia Special Region. The zone will \"take advantage of North Korean labor, land, environment and resources,\" says one of the signs in Nanping, displaying pictures of seafood processing and light manufacturing of clothes, clocks and car parts.One thousand North Korean workers were supposed to have started work last year, a number set to increase to 10,000 this year and 20,000 next year. But the dormitories for the workers are half-completed and the economic zone hasn't opened.\"Those signboards are more a hopeful plan than a schedule we strictly follow. No one has moved in yet,\" said the manager of one of the construction sites, who gave his family name as Li.According to signboards in Nanping, there were plans for 900 million yuan worth of infrastructure investment in the area,  including a 10-km (6-mile) train track connecting Nanping and nearby Luguo village to North Korea's Musan mine, which has the largest-known iron ore reserves in the country.RUDIMENTARY PLOWSVillagers on the Chinese side of the border are wary of North Korea. In 2014, in two separate incidents, at least seven villagers were killed by North Koreans sneaking across the porous border into Nanping, the latest in several such incidents over the past few years.China's military presence is heavy, with khaki green four-wheel drive vehicles patrolling the highways and security cameras installed on border fences. Locals say defections by North Koreans are down amid tighter Chinese patrols. However, recent flooding around Nanping has destroyed alarm systems installed by the local government to protect villagers against North Korean intruders and also much of the fencing separating the village from North Korea. North Korea is clearly visible from Nanping - farmers using rudimentary plows, soldiers squatting by a simple outpost and antiquated trucks and buses sporadically rumbling by. Timber and other materials come in by truck from North Korea to Nanping over a concrete bridge, say locals, who added that coal exports have stopped since China's outright ban in February, following the North's nuclear and intermediate-range ballistic missile tests.Iron ore from Musan has also stopped coming in, said Li Zhonglin, Director of the College of Economics and Management at Yanbian University.\"Right now, all economic projects along the border have stalled because of rising tensions,\" he said.

There had to be a commitment to using diplomatic means to peacefully settle the North Korea issue, Wang said. A U.S. think tank reported last month that satellite imagery of North Korea's main nuclear test site indicates that Pyongyang could be in the final stages of preparations for a sixth nuclear test.Also last month, North Korea state media said the country had conducted a test of a high-thrust engine that would help  achieve world-class satellite launch capability, indicating the test was of a new type of rocket engine for long-range missiles.Trump's top national security aides have completed a broad review of U.S. options aimed at countering North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, a senior U.S. official said on Sunday.The review includes economic and military measures but leans towards new sanctions and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its neighbor and ally, the official said.

A spokesman for the Kyrgyz GKNB security service identified the suspect as Akbarzhon Jalilov, born in the city of Osh in 1995, but provided no other details.Russia has been on particular alert against attacks on its soil in reprisal for its military intervention in Syria, where Moscow's forces have been supporting troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Islamic State group has repeatedly threatened revenge attacks.If it is confirmed that the bomber was linked to radical Islamists, some sections of Russian society could see it as proof that Moscow's decision to intervene in Syria has made civilians into targets.There was no immediate claim of responsibility.Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic of six million, is a close political ally of Moscow and hosts a Russian military airbase.Late on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the site of the blast, which made a huge hole in the side of a carriage and blew of the door, with metal wreckage strewn across the platform.Passengers were seen hammering at the windows of one closed carriage after the train had pulled into the Sennaya Ploshad station at around 2:40 p.m.Russian TV said many had suffered lacerations from glass shards and metal, the force of the explosion amplified by the confines of the carriage and the tunnel.St Petersburg television showed footage of the corpse of a bearded man they said was the perpetrator. The man resembled footage of a man captured on closed circuit television who Russian media said was a suspect.Officials said they were treating the blast as an act of terrorism, but there was no official confirmation of any link to Islamist radicals.The National Anti-Terrorist Committee said an explosive device had been found at another station, hidden in a fire extinguisher, but had been defused.Authorities closed all St. Petersburg metro stations. The Moscow metro said it was taking unspecified additional security measures in case of an attack there.The blast raised security fears beyond Russian frontiers.

Pence then went to Capitol Hill to meet the Freedom Caucus, a group of House conservatives who last month derailed a healthcare bill backed by President Donald Trump.The White House would like to see a revised bill come up for a vote as early as week's end, before the House breaks for a spring recess, and the text of the new proposal could be ready some time on Tuesday, lawmakers said.\"It was clear the president would be very happy come Friday to have this passed,\" said U.S. Representative Chris Collins, a member of the Tuesday Group and a Trump ally. \"This could move fairly quickly,\" he said.Just 10 days ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to cancel a vote on a bill to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, when it was clear he could not deliver the votes needed for it to pass.The defeat was a big political setback for Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress who were elected on pledges to repeal  and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.Freedom Caucus members said the Republican bill was too similar to Obamacare, while moderate Republicans balked at some of the changes conservatives sought.Trump attacked Freedom Caucus members on Twitter late last week for their opposition to the bill and threatened to work to defeat them in the 2018 congressional elections.At the weekend, he struck a more conciliatory tone, tweeting early on Sunday: \"Talks on Repealing and Replacing Obamacare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.\"After golfing with the president on Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul, a sharp critic of the Republicans' previous healthcare bill, also expressed renewed hope the healthcare bill could be revised in a way that picked up support from the conservative and moderate factions of the Republican Party.Paul told reporters he was \"very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement repealing Obamacare.\"KEY PROVISIONSPence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus laid out the administration's revised healthcare plan during a 40-minute meeting with Freedom Caucus members, said Congressman Mark Meadows, the leader of the conservative group.Meadows said he was \"intrigued\" by the new plan, which would allow states to opt out of some of Obamacare's mandates, possibly by obtaining waivers.\"We're encouraged ... but would certainly need a whole lot more information before we can take any action either in support or in opposition,\" Meadows told reporters. He expected to see a detailed draft of the proposal within 24 hours, he said.In the earlier meeting with the moderate Tuesday Group, White House officials said the new plan would preserve Obamacare's essential health benefits clause, or services and care that insurers must cover, but states could apply for a waiver if they could show it would improve coverage and reduce costs, according to Collins.Trump aides also discussed directing funds from the $115 billion stability fund for states into high-risk pools for people with pre-existing health conditions to better ensure insurance premiums come down in cost, Collins said.\"It's an acknowledgement that they were chasing votes with the Freedom Caucus and the Far Right and then ended up losing votes with those of us who are typically the most reliable votes,\" Collins said of the proposal provisions discussed at the meeting.

(For a graphic on THAAD missile defense system click tmsnrt.rs/2nxSpbA) While the United States says THAAD is needed to protect Seoul from the threat posed by North Korea's growing nuclear and missile programs, some Chinese strategists believe it is also a threat to the viability of China's nuclear deterrent.\"It is clear that there is no one in China who really knows the technical capability of THAAD and that's part of the problem,\" said Zhang Baohui, a Hong Kong-based mainland expert on China's nuclear deterrent.  \"THAAD's full capabilities are secret so there is a real knowledge gap among Chinese strategists. If they are misplaced, they are at least genuine in their concern - they have to assume a worst case scenario.\"Officially, China says it objects to THAAD because it will destabilize the regional security balance.Chinese officials have also expressed concern about the reported 2,000 km (1,200 mile) range of THAAD's powerful X-band radars, which can look deep into the mainland, rather than the system's shorter range interceptor missiles that can target North Korea's missiles.Besides casting a shadow over U.S.-China ties, THAAD has also ruptured the relationship between Seoul and Beijing.Chinese authorities have closed dozens of Lotte retail stores on the mainland after the South Korean conglomerate agreed to provide land for the missile defense system.There has been a sharp decline in Chinese tourists going to South Korea, while South Korean singers and actors have been blocked in various ways from reaching a mainland Chinese audience, and dozens of Korean-focused blogs suspended in China.NEVER TESTEDTHAAD, never tested in a conflict and whose effectiveness is still questioned by some Western experts, is designed to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles late in flight, either just inside or outside the earth's atmosphere.The range of its radars however can help the system cover missile and rocket launch sites deep in China's isolated northeast where the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tests its modern generation of long-range weapons, some Chinese experts fear.China's nuclear deterrent is based around ensuring it has a credible \"second strike\" capability given its long-standing vow never to be the first to use a nuclear weapon in a conflict.Beijing is rebuilding its arsenal of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as a fleet of submarines capable of firing such weapons, to ensure the so-called \"survivability\" of that deterrent.Some Chinese scientists fear that the THAAD radars are sophisticated enough to allow the United States to track tests and specific missile signatures, ultimately helping it better prepare to counter any future Chinese attack.Li Bin, a security expert at Beijing's Tsinghua University, wrote recently that the THAAD radars would allow the U.S. military to obtain data on missiles that it could not get through other sources, clearly undermining China's nuclear strategy.In another recent commentary, Li noted differing unofficial Chinese views over the range of THAAD's radars, a discrepancy he said pointed to a lack of knowledge.  Some experts have however stressed that the PLA has both hard and soft options for crippling the THAAD's radars, such as the use of laser weapons or, less provocatively, deception maneuvers to confuse them.Peng Guangqian, a strategist at the PLA Academy of Military Science, told the state-owned Global Times tabloid earlier this month that it was easy to \"blind\" the radars.\"We can also make THAAD useless through electronic interference and feigned military activities, because such activities can interrupt the functioning of the THAAD system.\"Beyond debates over the THAAD's range, mainland strategists believe the system can be linked into a broader U.S.-led network of early warning radars, sensors and battle management systems in the region and tie in neighboring nations into an alliance.Yao Yunzhu, a retired PLA major general, warned a Shanghai conference last month that such a network ultimately targeted China.And that, say experts outside China, lies at the core of Beijing's fears over THAAD - a South Korea tied ever more tightly to the U.S. and Japan, despite years of effort by Beijing to draw Seoul closer.Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told the conference that he believed that China's missile forces were large and sophisticated enough to be impossible to defend against, so THAAD need not be a concern to Beijing.He did say, however, that it \"conceivably could enhance\" other missile/anti-missile systems in the region.

Russia's largest oil firm has been subject to sanctions since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Chief Executive Igor Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is himself under sanctions.Sanctions complicate fund-raising for the state-run Rosneft and have prevented western companies from helping it develop deepwater, shale and Arctic oil deposits, including a large venture with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).Rosneft is attempting to annul EU sanctions in the European General Court, following a ruling by the European Court of Justice that the matter can be heard in Brussels.Rosneft is challenging the legality of sanctions, saying the General Court set a precedent when it annulled some EU sanctions against Iranian banks. The decision was later confirmed by the European Court of Justice.Rosneft said the Iranian banks had successfully challenged sanctions intended to curb Iran's nuclear program because there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the banks.The General Court had recognized that the banks were not involved in Tehran's nuclear activities, Rosneft said in legal arguments.Rosneft is hoping to benefit from a similar attitude to sanctions imposed over Ukraine. The oil firm said it had \"not committed any illegal actions in any jurisdiction, including Ukraine, and has nothing to do with the Ukrainian crisis\".In 2014, the European Court of Justice struck down an EU decision to freeze the assets of Iran's central bank, a measure put in place prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.Last year, Iran's Bank Mellat also won a case that its assets should not have been frozen. It argued that it was not linked to Iran's nuclear program.The EU council said it could not comment on the case in the General Court (Case T-715/14) as it was still ongoing. The timing of its ruling was not immediately known.Sarosh Zaiwalla, a lawyer who represented Bank Mellat in its case against the EU, said there were parallels with Rosneft's position.\"The EU has not been able so far to produce any evidence that Rosneft ...  was involved in or supported in any way the conflict in Ukraine,\" he said.\"In 2016, an EU court ruled that EU sanctions on Bank Mellat were imposed illegally because of lack of evidence of any involvement by Mellat in Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\" Zaiwalla said.

Twelve people died in police lock-ups in 2015.Last week, citing documents from Suhakam, Reuters reported that 118 foreigners, including undocumented workers, refugees and asylum seekers, had died at detention centers in the last two years. More than half the dead were from Myanmar.Suhakam said deaths mostly stemmed from diseases in all prisons and detention centers, where the government should look to improve conditions and healthcare.\"There is little interest in the human rights of detainees,\" said Chairman Razali Ismail. \"This attitude is reflected in government budgetary priorities and the resources made available for the running and upkeep of all places of detention.\" Particularly in immigration detention centers, people spent long periods unable to move freely or sleep comfortably in overcrowded cells, he said, where conditions sometimes deteriorated to become \"inhumane\".The government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Suhakam's report, published on Tuesday.Former detainees, government agencies and rights groups have told Reuters of grim living conditions in detention camps that are overcrowded and unhygienic.Some said they received insufficient food, water or healthcare, and many developed skin and lung infections, or contagious diseases. All those interviewed also alleged they were beaten by camp guards or saw others being beaten.Suhakam documents reviewed by Reuters showed detainees died from lung infections, heart-related conditions and the bacterial disease leptospirosis. No cause was attributed for 50 deaths.Last week, deputy home minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed told Reuters his ministry had hit a budget brick wall in efforts to improve conditions in immigration detention centers. Malaysia's 13 detention centers had a total of 86,795 detainees during various periods in 2016, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission says. \"UNFIT AND UNSAFE\"Two of the detention centers Suhakam visited last year were in dilapidated condition, the agency said in its report.Three blocks of a detention center in southern Johor state, and two blocks on northern Penang island were held \"unfit and unsafe for occupation,\" by the Public Works Department, it added.The rights agency said the immigration department last week informed it of \"major reforms,\" such as better healthcare and repair of dilapidated structures.Southeast Asia-based migrant and refugee protection group Fortify Rights urged a criminal investigation into the deaths.\"Malaysian authorities could begin tackling this by ending arbitrary and indefinite detention of migrants, including refugees and survivors of trafficking,\" Executive Director Amy Smith said in a statement.

The Islamic State group has repeatedly threatened revenge attacks.If it is confirmed that the bomber was linked to radical Islamists, some sections of Russian society could see it as proof that Moscow's decision to intervene in Syria has made civilians into targets.There was no immediate claim of responsibility.Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic of six million, is a close political ally of Moscow and hosts a Russian military airbase.Late on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the site of the blast, which made a huge hole in the side of a carriage and blew of the door, with metal wreckage strewn across the platform.Passengers were seen hammering at the windows of one closed carriage after the train had pulled into the Sennaya Ploshad station at around 2:40 p.m.Russian TV said many had suffered lacerations from glass shards and metal, the force of the explosion amplified by the confines of the carriage and the tunnel.St Petersburg television showed footage of the corpse of a bearded man they said was the perpetrator. The man resembled footage of a man captured on closed circuit television who Russian media said was a suspect.Officials said they were treating the blast as an act of terrorism, but there was no official confirmation of any link to Islamist radicals.The National Anti-Terrorist Committee said an explosive device had been found at another station, hidden in a fire extinguisher, but had been defused.Authorities closed all St. Petersburg metro stations. The Moscow metro said it was taking unspecified additional security measures in case of an attack there.The blast raised security fears beyond Russian frontiers. France, which has itself suffered a series of attacks, announced additional security measures in Paris.

Cambodia said it was because it would be too busy with elections then and rejected any connection to China.Last year, Beijing held a joint naval drill with Cambodia for the first time. Cambodia's armed forces have benefited from Chinese training and equipment including jeeps, rocket launchers and helicopters.Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has boasted of his new friendship with China despite a longstanding territorial dispute. Thailand's military junta has increased purchases of Chinese hardware, including a further 10 tanks approved by the cabinet on Tuesday. The reduction in military links with Cambodia would be a setback for U.S. strategy in the region but Hun Sen could also end up losing out, said Carl Thayer, professor at the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defense Force Academy.\"His anti-U.S. actions will only increase Cambodia's dependency on China,\" he said.

But she concedes there might not be the same \"driving force\" for action.Student union leaders like Cheryl Chu and Thomas Lee agree that the commitment is still there, but they doubt mass protests are the way to go, for now.The Umbrella Movement ultimately failed to persuade Beijing to grant full democracy in elections for Chief Executive, so Carrie Lam will assume the post in July thanks to the backing last month of an electoral college packed with mostly Beijing loyalists.In the run-up to Lam's victory, student leaders eschewed public protests and opted instead to use social media, leaflets and street booths to present their case that the election was undemocratic.\"We need to look further in future, and look at how to slowly make the people close to us change a little. Only then will we feel that we can achieve something tangible in future,\u201d said Lee.Many activist leaders have been weighed down by legal battles. One day after Lam's selection, nine were charged with public nuisance offences for their part in the protests, and more arrests could follow.Victories in last September's elections to the city's legislature, when one in five voters backed younger candidates including Umbrella Movement leaders and self-determination advocates, rapidly turned sour when two newly elected legislators were disqualified. Beijing and a local court ruled Baggio Leung and Yau Wai-ching had not taken their oaths properly after inserting a dig at China.The government has since sought to disqualify four more pro-democracy lawmakers for invalid oaths, while two others charged for inciting the Umbrella protests might be removed if they are jailed for over a month.\"NEVER REST\"For some young people like Derek Lam, 23, a theology student who has been arrested five times in two years for various protests, there is a financial cost to their activism.Lam has not been convicted, but says his high-profile arrests mean he now struggles to find work and might not be able to graduate if he fails to pay his half-year school fee of HK$24,000 (US$3,090).But the setbacks have not deterred him.\"The Chinese Communist Party will never rest, so we can't rest as well ... Luckily, we have 30 years, and after 30 years our opponents will not be the people who are in power now, but people our age. So a lot depends on how we influence our peers now.\"This July, on the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China from British rule, Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit the city. But while many activists are appalled by what they see as a gradual ratcheting up of Chinese control during the 50-year period of transitional autonomy agreed with Britain, they are not expecting a protest on the scale of 2014.\"The fight for democracy doesn't just take place on the streets,\" said Joshua Wong, the public face of the Umbrella Movement, who was just 17 when the protests began. \"And the fight for Hong Kong's autonomy doesn't take place in years. We are talking about a battle of 20, 30 years.\"The challenge for Beijing is that many of Hong Kong's young people, rather than growing to accept China's growing role in the city's affairs, have become further estranged from the mainland and are increasingly warming to a localism movement that puts the city's autonomy, interests and culture first.\"The youths in Hong Kong are now more eager to step up and say we're Hong Kongers, we love Hong Kong and distinguish ourselves from the Chinese. There is a very strong Hong Kong identity, and this will not waver,\" said Wong Ching-tak, 20, the president of the University of Hong Kong's Student Union.Disqualified legislators Leung and Yau hope that identity will mobilize supporters when the next battleground issue crops up. \"There will be a last war ... There will be a very large-scale social movement that emerges,\" Leung said. \"And it will determine whether there's still a road ahead for Hong Kong as we know it, or not.\" (Reporting by James Pomfret and Venus Wu; Additional reporting by Katy Wong; Editing by Will Waterman)"},

But they see her losing to centrist Emmanuel Macron in a May 7 runoff.Regulators and investors are unwilling to rule out any surprises following the Brexit and U.S. presidential votes last year which confounded pollsters' expectations.After French bond yields spiked in February on poll gains by Le Pen, ECB supervisors have sought to ensure banks have fully sized up the risks of the unexpected, four senior bankers told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the political sensitivity of the matter.\"We've been asked what's our plans for different scenarios including Frexit,\" one of the bankers said.The ECB declined to comment.One scenario lenders have been asked about is the possibility of Le Pen scoring higher than predicted in the first round, thus increasing her chances of winning the presidency in the runoff two weeks later.\"For a fortnight we'd be absolutely fine to get through any difficulties,\" said a second banking executive, speaking about a possible short-term liquidity squeeze in credit markets. The industry could easily weather a bout of brief volatility, the banker added.Banks are taking the requests in their stride since ECB officials are including the questions in their regular surveillance checks, rather than asking them to separately compile and submit detailed plans.The lenders are also having to outline their preparations to foreign investors, according to the sources. In some cases they have had to explain how the election process works, with the first round serving to whittle down a wide field of candidates to just two hopefuls, who will contest the runoff. \"Foreign investors are asking a lot of questions. We have to keep explaining that there are two rounds,\" said a third senior executive at French bank.Some Paris-based lawyers said they were getting questions from investors about whether it was legally possible for France to dump the euro, how the Frexit process might work and what the state could do if a bank run resulted.\"What's sure is that if there is a risk of a bank run and something needs to be done, the state can do it by decree,\" one lawyer said, citing the example of Cyprus implementing capital controls when its banks faced collapse in 2013.Meanwhile, retail French investors are keeping their money liquid with popular tax-free regulated savings accounts seeing large inflows in the last three months, said Pierre-Rene Lemas the head of the state-backed Caisse des Depots, which collects the money deposited in such accounts at banks.

Trump had promised to end the lottery system for H1B visas, which gives each applicant an equal chance at 65,000 positions each year.Lobbyists for businesses who rely on H1B visas, commonly used by the tech sector, had expected Trump to upend the lottery in favor of a system that prioritized workers who are highly skilled and would be highly paid in the United States.The lottery for fiscal year 2018 opened on Monday without changes.The start of the lottery was seen by those watching the issue as the unofficial deadline for the Trump administration to enact H1B visa reform, and the failure to meet that deadline signals that Trump's promised overhaul of the system may be off the table or long delayed. \"More oversight is a good start, but employers can still use the program legally to depress wages and replace American workers. That falls short of the promises President Trump made to protect American workers,\" said Peter Robbio, a spokesman for Numbers USA, a Washington-based group that advocates for limiting immigration into the United States. The Trump administration has taken other steps to crackdown on H1B visa abuse, such as issuing a Justice Department warning to employers and announcing plans to increase transparency on applicants.\"These are important first steps to bring more accountability and transparency to the H1B system,\" a White House official said. \"The administration is considering several additional options for the president to use his existing authority to ensure federal agencies more rigorously enforce all aspects of the program.\"Tech companies rely on the program to bring in workers with special skills and have lobbied for an expansion of the number of H1B visas awarded. Proponents of limiting legal immigration, including Trump's senior adviser Stephen Miller, have argued the program gives jobs that Americans could fill to foreign workers at a less expensive cost. The measures announced by DHS on Monday focus on site visits by U.S. authorities to employers who use H1B visas. In future site visits, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agents will investigate incidents where an employer's basic business information cannot be validated; businesses that have a high ratio of H1B employees compared with U.S. workers; and employers petitioning for H1B workers who work off-site.

Under the terms of the reorganization, Vale will become a company with no defined controlling shareholder within three years, a landmark step to help stifle state interference in the company.The deal represents a milestone in a country long hobbled by corporate governance scandals and reorganizations that hurt minority investors. It comes as Brazil's government is selling dozens of power and sanitation utilities, as well as assets of state-controlled oil company Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA).Companies announced $27.121 billion worth of Brazil-related mergers from January to March, up six-fold from a year earlier, the data showed. Excluding Vale, the value of M&A; deals reached $6.195 billion, less than half the amount seen in the same period four years ago, before the recession struck. The number of deals in the first quarter fell 35 percent to 108 from a year earlier, the data showed.Stricter legal and regulatory scrutiny has continued to put the brakes on M&A; announcements this year, compounding the impact of the recession and political turmoil that has kept keeping buyers and sellers at odds over valuations.According to Alessandro Zema and Eduardo Miras, co-heads of Brazil investment banking for Morgan Stanley, M&A; deals should accelerate this year, even if increased debt and equity capital markets activity posed some competition for the segment.Declining borrowing costs and a stable currency could spur Brazil's recovery and the pace of takeovers through year-end, they said. More consolidation efforts could take place, as companies try to cut debt, improve their capital and tax structures, and become more efficient.\"It's very hard for a strategic player or a financial sponsor to ignore Brazil because of the cycle,\" Zema said. \"The country's economy offers relevant opportunities for global players in almost every segment of activity.\"According to Alessandro Farkuh, Bradesco BBI's head of M&A;, more strategic players will seek to enter Brazil as President Michel Temer's administration passes pension, labor market and tax reforms aimed at restoring confidence in the economy.\"Activity will grow in a more robust manner once the macroeconomic uncertainties dissipate and players feel the outlook has turned much more predictable,\" Farkuh said.A challenge for buyers and sellers alike remains a lengthening M&A; execution cycle.

The manager also called the bank's ethics hot line. OSHA determined his whistleblowing was \"at least a contributing factor in his termination.\" The manager was not named.The bank is planning to request a full hearing on the OSHA decision before the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges. Such a step will not halt the initial reinstatement order.    \u201cWe take seriously the concerns of current and former team members. This decision is a preliminary order and to date there has been no hearing on the merits of this case.  We disagree with the findings and will be requesting a full hearing of the matter,\u201d said Vince Scanlon, a bank spokesman.According to OSHA, the manager had previously received positive job performance appraisals, but in 2010 he was told he had 90 days to find a new job at the bank after being dismissed as a manager. He was unable to do so and was terminated, and has not found work in banking since.The manager worked in Wells Fargo's wealth management group, according to the bank.The OSHA decision is unrelated to the bank's woes surrounding the creation of potentially millions of fake accounts by employees looking to hit sales goals. In that case, the bank has also come under scrutiny over whether it punished whistleblowers that notified superiors of wrongdoing involving  Wells Fargo employees.

Russia's largest oil firm has been subject to sanctions since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Chief Executive Igor Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is himself under sanctions.Sanctions complicate fund-raising for the state-run Rosneft and have prevented western companies from helping it develop deepwater, shale and Arctic oil deposits, including a large venture with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).Rosneft is attempting to annul EU sanctions in the European General Court, following a ruling by the European Court of Justice that the matter can be heard in Brussels.Rosneft is challenging the legality of sanctions, saying the General Court set a precedent when it annulled some EU sanctions against Iranian banks. The decision was later confirmed by the European Court of Justice.Rosneft said the Iranian banks had successfully challenged sanctions intended to curb Iran's nuclear program because there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the banks.The General Court had recognized that the banks were not involved in Tehran's nuclear activities, Rosneft said in legal arguments.Rosneft is hoping to benefit from a similar attitude to sanctions imposed over Ukraine. The oil firm said it had \"not committed any illegal actions in any jurisdiction, including Ukraine, and has nothing to do with the Ukrainian crisis\".In 2014, the European Court of Justice struck down an EU decision to freeze the assets of Iran's central bank, a measure put in place prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.Last year, Iran's Bank Mellat also won a case that its assets should not have been frozen. It argued that it was not linked to Iran's nuclear program.The EU council said it could not comment on the case in the General Court (Case T-715/14) as it was still ongoing. The timing of its ruling was not immediately known.Sarosh Zaiwalla, a lawyer who represented Bank Mellat in its case against the EU, said there were parallels with Rosneft's position.\"The EU has not been able so far to produce any evidence that Rosneft ...  was involved in or supported in any way the conflict in Ukraine,\" he said.\"In 2016, an EU court ruled that EU sanctions on Bank Mellat were imposed illegally because of lack of evidence of any involvement by Mellat in Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\" Zaiwalla said.

Twelve people died in police lock-ups in 2015.Last week, citing documents from Suhakam, Reuters reported that 118 foreigners, including undocumented workers, refugees and asylum seekers, had died at detention centers in the last two years. More than half the dead were from Myanmar.Suhakam said deaths mostly stemmed from diseases in all prisons and detention centers, where the government should look to improve conditions and healthcare.\"There is little interest in the human rights of detainees,\" said Chairman Razali Ismail. \"This attitude is reflected in government budgetary priorities and the resources made available for the running and upkeep of all places of detention.\" Particularly in immigration detention centers, people spent long periods unable to move freely or sleep comfortably in overcrowded cells, he said, where conditions sometimes deteriorated to become \"inhumane\".The government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Suhakam's report, published on Tuesday.Former detainees, government agencies and rights groups have told Reuters of grim living conditions in detention camps that are overcrowded and unhygienic.Some said they received insufficient food, water or healthcare, and many developed skin and lung infections, or contagious diseases. All those interviewed also alleged they were beaten by camp guards or saw others being beaten.Suhakam documents reviewed by Reuters showed detainees died from lung infections, heart-related conditions and the bacterial disease leptospirosis. No cause was attributed for 50 deaths.Last week, deputy home minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed told Reuters his ministry had hit a budget brick wall in efforts to improve conditions in immigration detention centers. Malaysia's 13 detention centers had a total of 86,795 detainees during various periods in 2016, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission says. \"UNFIT AND UNSAFE\"Two of the detention centers Suhakam visited last year were in dilapidated condition, the agency said in its report.Three blocks of a detention center in southern Johor state, and two blocks on northern Penang island were held \"unfit and unsafe for occupation,\" by the Public Works Department, it added.The rights agency said the immigration department last week informed it of \"major reforms,\" such as better healthcare and repair of dilapidated structures.Southeast Asia-based migrant and refugee protection group Fortify Rights urged a criminal investigation into the deaths.\"Malaysian authorities could begin tackling this by ending arbitrary and indefinite detention of migrants, including refugees and survivors of trafficking,\" Executive Director Amy Smith said in a statement.

The contract was for five years, with years two through five being optional, an SEC spokeswoman told Reuters at the time. If confirmed as SEC chairman, Clayton will have direct authority over contracting matters for the agency.A spokesman for Clayton declined to comment. Palantir did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the White House referred all questions to spokesmen for Clayton.Clayton also disclosed in his written responses that he communicated with others, including Rebekah Mercer, a Trump donor whose father, Robert Mercer, founded the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies; Genie Energy Ltd President Ira Greenstein; venture capitalist Darren Blanton; Martin Silverstein, a lawyer who is senior counsel with the law firm Greenberg Taurig and who was ambassador to Uruguay for four years under President George W.

He did not address whether any of the individuals may also have a financial stake in SEC contracts.The disclosure of his communications with Thiel come just one day before the Senate Banking Committee is set to vote on whether to send Clayton's nomination to the full Senate. He is still expected to be approved by the committee and later by the full Senate. The issue has the potential to stoke deeper concerns among some Democrats on the panel who already have misgivings about possible conflicts of interest.Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, told Reuters in a statement that Clayton should disclose more details about his talks with Thiel. \"We must be sure that no commitments or deals were made between Mr. Thiel and Mr. Clayton, especially pertaining to Thiel\u2019s company\u2019s pending business before the SEC,\" she said.At his confirmation hearing last month, Clayton was grilled repeatedly about possible conflicts of interest.

ABB spokesman Saswato Das declined to comment.The Swiss company said acquiring B&R; would increase its sales in industrial automation to around $15 billion by adding B&R;'s annual sales of more than $600 million.It would also consolidate ABB's position as the No. 2 in the $130 billion global processing and industrial sector behind Siemens (SIEGn.DE) but ahead of rivals like Emerson (EMR.N), Rockwell Automation and General Electric (GE.N).B&R; makes programmable controls for machines used by companies like Nestle (NESN.S), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Roche (ROG.S).The private company, founded by two electrical engineers in 1979, also makes components for machines used by automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen. Its products include industrial PCs and factory automation devices designed to increase productivity.ABB's shares were up 0.9 percent after the deal was announced.\"This is a sensible acquisition, increasing ABB's footprint on the factory floor where we expect higher growth in the future than in process industries like oil and gas,\" said Takis Spiliopoulos, an analyst at Bank Vontobel. He said spending on industrial automation was expected to grow by around 5 to 6 percent annually in the years ahead as Western companies bring back production from emerging markets, while oil and gas spending would remain subdued.ABB, which depends on oil and gas for around 15 percent of revenues, has been hit as falling oil prices have dented demand from oil producers for products such as temperature and pressure transmitters and flow measurement devices.Spiesshofer said the purchase of B&R; would make ABB the only industrial automation provider offering customers the entire spectrum of technology and software solutions around measurement, control, actuation, robotics, digitalization and electrification, Spiesshofer said.\"There will be more acquisitions ... as one of the drivers of growth going forward, but there is no 'must haves' we are desperate about,\" Spiesshofer told reporters. \"We are closing today perfectly the big gap we had in machine and factory automation, that was one gap we were always concerned about and wanted to close.\" ABB aims to increase B&R;'s annual sales to above $1 billion from around $600 million now and said the business would add to operating earnings per share from the first year.The purchase is being funded from ABB's own cash and is expected to close by mid-year.

From just one recorded incident in 2014, the number of thefts and attempted thefts from Petrobras rose to 14 in 2015 - before jumping five-fold to 73 last year, the company told Reuters.The racket is part of a larger crime wave in Brazil, and especially Rio, amid the country's worst recession on record. Investigators believe the oil and fuel thefts were masterminded by the city's powerful militias - often made up of retired or off-duty cops - as they seek to move away from terror and violence to lower-profile crimes following a crackdown by authorities in recent years.    The thieves' methods range from hijacking tanker trucks to tapping the company's more than 11,000 kilometers of pipelines - and processing stolen crude at their own secret refineries.\"Not even Petrobras knows exactly how much is being stolen,\" said Giniton Lages, the Rio police chief who led the investigation at Duque de Caxias. \"It's a huge business, moving millions of reais.\"INSIDE JOBWhile oil theft - often with environmental damage from the accompanying spills - is commonplace in regions like the Niger Delta of Nigeria, it has not traditionally been a problem in Brazil.The thefts add to the steep challenges facing Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio-based firm is formally known. Amid weak oil prices, the company is scaling back under new CEO Pedro Parente and trying to emerge from a $100 million pile of debt. For the past three years, the state-run company has been hit by a sprawling investigation into corruption and political kickbacks in its dealings with construction firms.Police suspect corruption in the oil thefts as well. The taps and pipes near the Duque de Caxias refinery were so precisely engineered that investigators concluded the thieves must have had help from inside Petrobras.\"They knew what type of fuel was inside each pipe and what was the ideal point to place a tap without the change of pressure in the tube raising the attention of the company's security system,\" Lages said.Petrobras, whose production of about 2.8 million barrels a day makes it one of the world's top 10 oil companies, said it was working with police to identify any employees or ex-employees that may have been involved in the crimes.\"In 2016, there was a startling increase in theft from our pipelines,\" said Rodrigo Spagnolo, head of pipeline maintenance at Transpetro, Petrobras' transport subsidiary.The company, however, said the robberies had no material impact on its earnings. Petrobras reported revenues of $81 billion last year.RUTHLESS GANGS The militias in Rio de Janeiro emerged to combat drug gangs in the city's violent hillside favelas. But they evolved into criminal organizations preying on those impoverished communities, controlling everything from real estate and electricity to cable TV. Some of the leaders entered local politics.In the wake of high-profile killings at the end of the last decade - prompting a government crackdown - the militia have maintained a lower profile, said Ignacio Cano, a professor at the state university of Rio de Janeiro and a member of its Laboratory for the Analysis of Violence.\"Stealing fuel was not typically a crime associated with militia, but they must see an opportunity for making millions,\" he said. \"It's unusual for them to operate outside the territory they control.\"Most oil and fuel thefts reported by Petrobras in 2016 took place on the populous Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro axis, which groups five of the company\u2019s biggest refineries.In Rio de Janeiro, thefts tripled last year to 33. Five of the incidents caused oil spills, Petrobras said.Police arrested 13 people for the Duque de Caxias refinery scam, including two military police officers. A judge has issued warrants for 26 others.The gang, set up in June 2015, stole 14 million liters (3.6 million gallons) of fuel last year, worth an estimated 33 million reais ($11 million), prosecutors said.Police believe the Rio branch of the gang was headed by Caxias Denilson Silva Pessanha, a former city councillor in Duque de Caxias and the owner of illegal gasoline stations. Such service stations, operating without a license or a distribution contract with a fuel supplier, have become more common in Brazilian cities in recent years. Pessanha, a fugitive, is wanted for torture and attempted homicide. Reuters attempts to locate an attorney for him were not successful. Transpetro said it was investing in more security, but Rio de Janeiro police say the company remains an easy target.\"The company's security officials who we have spoken to admit there is little they can do,\" Lages said. \"This involves armed gangs, and private security can do little about it because they are afraid.\" A SECRET REFINERYWhile Brazil's high unemployment and deep recession could be driving the thefts, Lages said, another motivation is the low risk of capture and punishment.Convictions are unlikely to result in imprisonment because Brazil's jails are chronically overcrowded.\"You might get a bit of community service time, so this is profitable and not much trouble,\" Lages said. Police are trying to classify the robberies as environmental crimes, which can carry up to five years in prison in cases where the pollution threatens humans or animals.The 13 people arrested in the Duque de Caxias refinery thefts were charged with forming a criminal enterprise, which also carries stiffer penalties.The scale of the crime has surprised police. At the end of last year, they uncovered a secret refinery in Boituva, Sao Paulo state, one of the installations used to process stolen crude.Video images show a large complex, with four giant storage tanks surrounded by a complex mesh of pipes, and a vast forecourt filled with unmarked tanker trucks.\"The gang was stealing oil from Petrobras' pipelines in Rio de Janeiro, filling trucks and taking it to these secret refineries,\" said Sao Paulo police chief Emerson Martins.The fuel would then be sold to illegal service stations and to small-scale vendors in rural towns or city slums, police say.The criminals sometimes use water trucks to transport the stolen cargo without drawing suspicion. In reaction, Brazil's Federal Highway Police have increased roadblocks on highways between Rio and Sao Paulo.\"The militia has rushed headfirst into this business,\" said Jose Helio Macedo, a spokesman for the police agency. \"We are trying to curb it.\"  (Additional reporting by Daniel Flynn; Writing by Daniel Flynn and Stephen Eisenhammer; Editing by Brian Thevenot)"},

China, the world's biggest auto market, accounted for over a quarter of the pair's 2016 overseas sales.A Chinese backlash over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system outside Seoul has targeted South Korean firms including Lotte Group with boycott calls in state media, protests and suspensions of operations.The move angered Beijing, although Seoul says the system is a response to North Korea's nuclear threat and is not aimed at China.While the diplomatic row is a nuisance, the bigger problem for the South Korean carmakers is stiff competition in China and the United States, where their mainstay sedans have lost market share to sport utility vehicles, analysts and sources said.SHIFT CUTSKia Motors has cut production shifts at its China factories, two of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Hyundai also had eliminated a second shift from its three factories in Beijing starting mid-March, one of the people said. The sources declined to be identified because the matter was not public. Hyundai and its smaller affiliate Kia said in a statement that they were \"adjusting operations at Chinese plants in line with the market environment\", but declined to elaborate on any cuts.Hyundai had already suspended output at its factory in Hebei from March 24 to April 4.  Operating one shift instead of two shifts is a \"drastic, rare move\" for the South Korean duo and could cut daily output by more than half, said Lee Myung-hoon, an analyst at HMC Investment & Securities. The anti-Korean sentiment was unlikely to end soon, he added, citing the example of the year-long backlash against Japan in 2012 over a territorial dispute which forced Japanese automakers to slash production.\"But I don't think the problems will be prolonged because it will have more harm on Chinese partners and local employment,\" he said. Poor consumer sentiment towards South Korean products in China had likely dragged down overseas sales in March, the companies said on Monday without putting a number on the falls. Hyundai Motor's China sales slumped 44 percent while sales of Kia, which has been in a dispute with dealers in China, suffered a steeper fall of 68 percent, sources said.     The sales downturn came despite the introduction of new models this year and a new Hyundai factory in China in 2016, and could explain some of the production cuts stemming from higher inventories.In the United States, Hyundai Motor posted a sales fall of 8 percent and Kia Motors slumped 15 percent in March from a year earlier. The U.S. market declined 2 percent in March.Hyundai Motor shares ended down 2.9 percent and Kia Motors declined 1.4 percent in the wider market, which was down 0.3 percent.

Pence then went to Capitol Hill to meet the Freedom Caucus, a group of House conservatives who last month derailed a healthcare bill backed by President Donald Trump.The White House would like to see a revised bill come up for a vote as early as week's end, before the House breaks for a spring recess, and the text of the new proposal could be ready some time on Tuesday, lawmakers said.\"It was clear the president would be very happy come Friday to have this passed,\" said U.S. Representative Chris Collins, a member of the Tuesday Group and a Trump ally. \"This could move fairly quickly,\" he said.Just 10 days ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to cancel a vote on a bill to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, when it was clear he could not deliver the votes needed for it to pass.The defeat was a big political setback for Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress who were elected on pledges to repeal  and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.Freedom Caucus members said the Republican bill was too similar to Obamacare, while moderate Republicans balked at some of the changes conservatives sought.Trump attacked Freedom Caucus members on Twitter late last week for their opposition to the bill and threatened to work to defeat them in the 2018 congressional elections.At the weekend, he struck a more conciliatory tone, tweeting early on Sunday: \"Talks on Repealing and Replacing Obamacare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.\"After golfing with the president on Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul, a sharp critic of the Republicans' previous healthcare bill, also expressed renewed hope the healthcare bill could be revised in a way that picked up support from the conservative and moderate factions of the Republican Party.Paul told reporters he was \"very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement repealing Obamacare.\"KEY PROVISIONSPence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus laid out the administration's revised healthcare plan during a 40-minute meeting with Freedom Caucus members, said Congressman Mark Meadows, the leader of the conservative group.Meadows said he was \"intrigued\" by the new plan, which would allow states to opt out of some of Obamacare's mandates, possibly by obtaining waivers.\"We're encouraged ... but would certainly need a whole lot more information before we can take any action either in support or in opposition,\" Meadows told reporters. He expected to see a detailed draft of the proposal within 24 hours, he said.In the earlier meeting with the moderate Tuesday Group, White House officials said the new plan would preserve Obamacare's essential health benefits clause, or services and care that insurers must cover, but states could apply for a waiver if they could show it would improve coverage and reduce costs, according to Collins.Trump aides also discussed directing funds from the $115 billion stability fund for states into high-risk pools for people with pre-existing health conditions to better ensure insurance premiums come down in cost, Collins said.\"It's an acknowledgement that they were chasing votes with the Freedom Caucus and the Far Right and then ended up losing votes with those of us who are typically the most reliable votes,\" Collins said of the proposal provisions discussed at the meeting.

(It) just washed the rail lines out. I haven't seen anything like this in my 60 years here,\" said Dennis Wilson, a caravan park owner who lives near the rail network.Cyclone Debbie, which struck last week as a category four storm, one rung below the most damaging category five, has left a disaster zone stretching 1,000 km (600 miles) in the northeastern sate of Queensland, with subsequent flooding claiming at least four lives.Queensland accounts for over 50 percent of global seaborne supplies of steel-making material coking coal, with the disruption driving up prices by over a quarter on Monday in their biggest single-day jump on record.Independent Australian mining analyst Peter Strachan said the rail lines were a vital link in the world's coking coal supply chain. \"I'd have thought the market might be taking too much of an optimistic view of how bad it is and as the information starts to seep out people will realize how long it's going to be,\" Strachan said. Between 12 and 15 million tonnes of coal shipments could be affected by the cyclone, Mark Pervan, chief economist at AME Group, said on Tuesday. Of that, about 10 million tonnes is coking coal, accounting for 3 percent of the global market.FORCE MAJEUREThree smaller producers in the region have already declared force majeure on coal cargoes, partly blaming rail lines being down. China's Yancoal Ltd has halted output at its Middlemount mine, while privately owned QCoal said it could not deliver two coal shipments \"due to infrastructure availability\".Jellinbah Group, which owns two mines in the region's Bowen Basin, said it had declared force majeure on some, but not all, shipments. While floodwaters have receded from many areas, last week's deluge is still flowing through river systems in Queensland. New Zealand is bracing for heavy rain on Tuesday as the storm crosses the Tasman Sea.A railway engineer, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the damaged tracks, said the land needed to dry before repair crews could get heavy machinery to the affected spots.BHP, the world's top exporter of coking coal, said it would \"seek to manage ongoing access to ports and shipments to customers\".The only alternative rail routes are to access lines heading north or south. The southern route is in a region forecast to be hit by further flooding this week, as levels in the major Fitzroy River catchment, continue to rise.

Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) also remains interested in Kate Spade, though it has not been pursuing an acquisition of the company as actively as rival fashion accessories maker Coach, the people said.Giving the sale process more time allows potential buyers to better assess Kate Spade's first-quarter sales and negotiate a potential deal, the people added.Kate Spade shares ended trading on Monday down 1.85 percent at $22.80, giving it a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion. If Kate Spade manages to negotiate a sale of the company, a deal would very likely value it below that level, according to the people. It is also possible that negotiations end without a deal, the people cautioned.Michael Kors and Coach declined to comment, as did Kate Spade.Affordable luxury brands such as Michael Kors and Coach have suffered after they expanded their retail presence too quickly and sold too heavily in outlet stores, diluting the exclusivity that once caused shoppers to line up for the next hot handbag.These brands have been hurt as fewer shoppers in malls have led to fewer handbag sales, while a stronger dollar has made it difficult for them to maintain their popularity with tourists visiting the United States.Kate Spade would offer Coach or Michael Kors greater pricing power with department stores, as well a younger clientele.Coach has been seeking to diversify its business beyond handbags. It paid $574 million for designer footwear company Stuart Weitzman in 2015.Michael Kors, which sells apparel, handbags, watches and other accessories, said in its most recent earnings call it was \"actively looking\" at potential acquisitions and that it probably would not do small deals. The company has been focused on a turnaround by improving its outlets and stores.Kate Spade has been under pressure from a small New York-based hedge fund, Caerus Investors, whose stake in the company could not be determined. Caerus sent a letter to Kate Spade's board in November, stating it was \"increasingly frustrated\" by the inability of the retailer's management to achieve profit margins comparable with industry peers.Separately, investor Barry Rosenstein's activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC has also revealed a small stake in the company.

AIG ranked last through March 21 among 10 insurers rated by their own employees in categories ranging from career opportunities to business outlook, according to a UBS analysis of data from Glassdoor Inc, which runs a careers website and database of millions of company reviews.     An AIG spokesman declined to comment.Last year, AIG ranked last in seven of 10 categories rated by Glassdoor users, including employees and agents. Factors also include compensation, senior management and cultural values. AIG, which announced on March 9 that its chief executive, Peter Hancock, would be stepping down, has ranked at or near  the bottom of the group in all categories since 2012, wrote UBS analyst Brian Meredith in a report to UBS customers. The morale slump could threaten a two-year turnaround plan put in place at AIG after billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn became AIG's fourth-largest investor in 2015, Meredith said.AIG is midway through the plan, which involves divesting businesses, cutting costs and ultimately returning $25 billion to shareholders. A $5.6 billion addition to reserves to cover future claims led AIG to report an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss on Feb. 14, jolting investors and leading to Hancock\u2019s planned departure.Hancock's successor has not yet been announced, though several names have been cited by analysts and in media reports. The board has pledged to find a new CEO quickly.     The data is an indication of AIG's challenges in \"retaining and hiring underwriting talent\" in its commercial property and casualty businesses during the last several years, wrote Meredith. Dim views of AIG among employees and agents signal \"the challenges that AIG continues to face in retaining and hiring talent it needs\" to boost and maintain its commercial property and casualty insurance businesses, said Meredith. The UBS analysis involved about 6,300 reviews posted on Glassdoor that UBS identified as being from employees of large property and casualty insurers, including Travelers Cos Inc and The Hartford. More than 1,400 of the 6,300 reviews were from AIG employees.CNA Insurance has scored the highest ratings so far in 2017, while Travelers ranked the highest last year, according to UBS.

The LNG market is undergoing huge changes as the biggest ever flood of new supply is hitting the market, with volumes coming mainly from the United States and Australia.President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday Russia aimed to become the world's largest LNG producer. The flurry of LNG production has resulted in global installed LNG capacity of over 300 million tonnes a year, while only around 268 million tonnes of LNG were traded in 2016, Thomson Reuters data shows. That has helped pull down Asian spot LNG prices by more than 70 percent from their 2014 peaks to $5.65 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).Qatar's decision to lift the moratorium on new gas development now could help the tiny Gulf monarchy maintain a competitive edge after 2020, when the global LNG market is expected to tighten.\"With global activity levels and costs low, now is a good time to add new capacity, even if the LNG market does presently look over supplied,\" Giles Farrer, research director, global LNG at Wood Mackenzie, said in an email.\"It's a signal that Qatar intends to increase its market share, which has been falling as other regions have built new capacity.\"An energy advisor to the Qatar government said he saw it as a preemptive step to warn competitors who are considering LNG investments that Qatar remains an aggressive seller.\"It will certainly give rivals something to chew on,\" he said, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly.The announcement coincides with the start of a major LNG industry conference this week in Japan, attended by many of its competitors and potential new customers.Kaabi said low prices would not pressure Qatar.\"By the time this project comes online in five years or so it should be a good market for gas,\" he said.IRAN NO ENEMYIran, which suffers severe domestic gas shortages, has made a rapid increase in production from South Pars a top priority and signed a preliminary deal with France's Total in November to develop its South Pars II project. Iran's oil minister last week vowed to ramp up production of its part of the shared field.\"Iran's gas production in South Pars can exceed Qatar's before the end of new Iranian year (ending March 20, 2018),\" Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency on Thursday.Total was the first Western energy company to sign a major deal with Tehran since the lifting of international sanctions.Kaabi said the decision to lift the moratorium was not prompted by Iran's plan to develop its part of the shared field.\"What we are doing today is something completely new and we will in future of course ... share information on this with them (Iran).\" The economy of Qatar, a future World Cup host with a population of 2.6 million, has been pressured by the global oil slump and in 2015 QP dismissed thousands of workers and has earmarked a number of assets for divestment.QP is merging two LNG divisions, Qatargas and RasGas, to save hundreds of millions of dollars.In February, Kaabi said Qatar would focus on seeking international opportunities by exploring for oil and gas in Cyprus and Morocco.But the current low LNG price environment may deter investment in new supply projects, bringing tighter supplies and price spikes in the future.

But as the number three player, it also is under growing pressure from investors and its own employees to consider its bottom line, as well as market share.One of the sources said there had been at least five townhalls in recent weeks, with founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal delivering motivational speeches.\"It was only profitability and profitability,\" one source said, describing answers to questions from employees whether the company was a takeover target.India's booming online retail sector is led by homegrown player Flipkart - now followed by Amazon, after the U.S. giant overtook Snapdeal's sales volumes a year ago.Thanks to its deep pockets, Amazon has been an increasingly prominent investor in India, compensating for its mistakes in China, where it has been all but squeezed out by aggressive local rivals with a better grasp of demand.Snapdeal sought funding support in China, from Chinese funds and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, already an investor, sources with knowledge of the matter said.It has so far come back empty handed.Snapdeal expects to turn profitable in two years and is eyeing a market listing around the same time.But the China setback, and a valuation that has dropped from a peak of $6.5 billion last year, has unsettled some staff.Two employees and three people familiar with Snapdeal's internal discussions said there were concerns over the group's direction, as well as over contradictory messages from investors - some seeking profit, others growth - and, increasingly, over potential senior-level departures or cuts.Headhunters like Sinosh Panicker, a partner at Hunt Partners, said some of his clients had witnessed a jump in applications from Snapdeal employees.    Some employees cite concerns after the departure of 600 staff in February, laid off from Snapdeal, its logistics arm Vulcan Express and payments unit FreeCharge.Snapdeal declined to comment on staff exits or sentiment, but said its annual appraisals were currently underway, and staff would be offered incentives. In a letter to employees late last month, co-founder and chief executive Bahl said that Snapdeal, in which Japan's SoftBank is also an investor, was on the right path, despite differing views from some investors.\"Investors in our industry need to understand that driving indiscriminate growth at any cost doesn't create long-term value,\" Bahl wrote in the letter.A spokeswoman for SoftBank in India declined comment while other Snapdeal investors - Nexus Venture Partners and Kalaari Capital - did not respond to Reuters queries.
